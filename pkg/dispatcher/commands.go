// cancelGracePeriod is how long we wait after firing the engine-level
// context cancel before force-removing the sandbox container as a
// belt-and-braces guarantee. Short enough that the operator sees the
// run end within a single attention span, long enough to let the
// engine's defer chain (sandbox.Cleanup) tear down cleanly on the
// happy path (in which case our docker rm just hits "No such
// container" and no-ops).
const cancelGracePeriod = 3 * time.Second

// forceRemoveSandboxContainer is the belt-and-braces cleanup for the
// /cancel API path. Without it, `claude --print` running inside a long-
// lived sandbox container often survives the engine context-cancel
// chain (docker exec dies on host, but dockerd doesn't always propagate
// SIGKILL into the container's PID namespace in time) — operators see
// the UI report "cancel requested" and the bot keeps streaming events
// for up to a minute. Finding
// `2026-05-25-dispatcher-cancel-doesnt-stop-claude-subprocess.md`
// captures the user-facing surface.
//
// Naming convention: the docker driver names every per-run container
// `iterion-<RunID>` (see `pkg/sandbox/docker/driver.go`); this helper
// targets that pattern via `docker rm --force`. Best-effort: a missing
// docker binary, a no-such-container error, or any other docker-side
// failure is logged at debug and never propagates — the engine's own
