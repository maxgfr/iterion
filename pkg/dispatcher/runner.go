	// ResumeFromRunID, when non-empty, signals the runner to resume
	// the named prior run (via runtime.Engine.Resume) instead of
	// minting a fresh execution. The dispatcher sets this on retry
	// when the prior run terminated in a resumable status — the
	// engine then picks up at the failing node, reuses the same
	// worktree, and inherits the prior checkpoint. RunID should be
	// equal to ResumeFromRunID when this is set (the resume reuses
	// the same on-disk run record).

	// Assignee is the issue's assignee at dispatch time. Empty when
	// the issue has no assignee (or the tracker doesn't carry one).
	// A RoutingRunner inspects this to pick a per-assignee workflow.

	// Issue is the back-reference to the kanban issue that triggered
	// this dispatch. nil for direct CLI / studio launches; non-nil
	// when buildSpec was driven by the dispatcher actor. The

	// so the studio's RunHeader can link back to the ticket.

	// engine goroutine.
