// Package server — memoization for the runs-stats aggregation.
//
// The /api/v1/runs/stats handler walks every recent run's events.jsonl
// (one store.ScanEvents per run) to sum per-node `_cost_usd`. That walk
// is the expensive part of the dashboard: a 30-day store with hundreds
// of runs re-reads every log on each Refresh, and the studio's window
// chips (7/14/30/90d) multiply that by repeated loads of overlapping
// run sets.
//
// runStatsCache memoizes the per-run cost-by-day map — the only
// expensive, run-scoped output of the aggregation. Duration and status
// come from the in-memory RunSummary (already loaded by ListCtx) and are
// cheap, so they are not cached.
//
// Why terminal-runs-only, version-keyed:
//
//   - store.AppendEvent does NOT bump run.UpdatedAt, so a cache keyed on
//     UpdatedAt would serve stale cost for an in-flight run that keeps
//     appending node_finished events. We therefore cache ONLY terminal
//     runs (RunStatus.IsTerminal): once a run reaches finished / failed /
//     failed_resumable / cancelled it appends no further events, so its
//     cost-by-day map is immutable. Non-terminal runs are never cached
//     and are re-scanned on every request — they are few, and this keeps
//     the live numbers honest. This is the implicit "invalidate on
//     event-write" guarantee: a cached entry corresponds to a run that
//     receives no further writes.
//
//   - The lone path that mutates an already-terminal run is
//     `iterion resume --force` re-finishing it, which advances UpdatedAt.
//     We fold UpdatedAt (and Status) into the version key so that case
//     busts the cache automatically.
//
// The key is built from RunSummary fields, not a file stat, so the cache
// is store-agnostic (works for the Mongo/cloud store too).
