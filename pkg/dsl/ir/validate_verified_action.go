//   - C103 — the policy must be a known value.
//   - C104 — recovery (policy: recover, or any recovery: bound) requires a
//     postcondition; without the truth oracle, adaptive recovery would
//     reintroduce the façade risk the gate model exists to prevent.
//   - C105 — a GATE is the degenerate quad (recipe == postcondition); it
//     must never declare recovery. "Never attach LLM recovery to a gate."
//   - C106 — recovery bounds/model only run under policy: recover; declaring
//     them under any other policy is dead config.
