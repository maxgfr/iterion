# Iterion Bot Catalog — for whats-next.bot's `propose_roadmap`, `revise_roadmap`, and `emit_action`

Consumed by three phases:

1. **`propose_roadmap` / `revise_roadmap`** — pick the right
   bot name for each `roadmap_item.assignee`. Leave it `""`
   when no existing bot fits.
2. **`emit_action`** — validate every assignee against the
   catalog before creating issues. Unrecognised assignees get
   stripped to `""` and the issue is labelled
   `needs-manual-triage`.

**Trust check first**: this catalog enumerates bots that exist
in the iterion source tree. If the workspace is NOT iterion,
none of these will resolve — all assignees should be `""` and
all issues will be `needs-manual-triage`.

## The pivot: kanban-driven, not shell-driven

whats-next.bot no longer shells out `iterion run <bot>`. Instead
every roadmap item becomes a kanban issue on the native board at
`<workspace>/.iterion/dispatcher/`, and a **dispatcher** dispatches
them. The dispatcher is wired via `iterion dispatch <config.yaml>`.

**Important feature gap (today)**: the dispatcher dispatches a
SINGLE workflow for all eligible issues — it does NOT yet route
by `issue.assignee`. Until that ships, the operator has two
choices:
1. Run multiple dispatchers, one per assignee, each filtering by
   state or label.
2. Wait for the routing feature (which whats-next may have
   proposed as its `next_action` on this run).

In either case, whats-next records the assignee on the issue so
the future routing has the data it needs.

## Decision tree — pick `assignee` per roadmap item

Walk top-to-bottom; first match wins.

| If the work sounds like… | → `assignee` |
|---|---|
| "implement feature X", "add capability", "build the thing" | `vibe_feature_dev` |
| "review the whole codebase", "audit production-readiness", "find bugs anywhere" | `whole_improve_loop` |
| "focus on axis X" (security / observability / perf …) across the codebase | `whole_improve_loop` (with `--var improvement_prompt=…`) |
| "review this branch", "review the PR", "fix the diff against main" | `branch_improve_loop` |
| "upgrade dependencies", "patch CVEs", "bump versions" | `secured-renovacy` |
| "audit the docs", "find code↔doc drift", "doc/code alignment", "fix outdated README/CLAUDE.md" | `doc-align` |
| architectural choice, hiring, prioritisation meeting, alignment | `""` |
| operator is vague or it's cross-cutting | `""` |
| long-term theme (a quarter+ horizon) | usually `""` |

When in doubt, prefer `""` and let the operator triage manually
in the board UI. An empty assignee is honest; a wrong one
wastes a bot run.

## Bot reference

### `vibe_feature_dev`

- **Path**: `examples/bots/vibe_feature_dev.bot`
- **Required var**: `feature_prompt` (one feature + acceptance
  criteria).
- **Pipeline**: plan → act → simplify → alternating Claude/GPT
  review/fix → commit.
- **Budget**: 1 branch, 4h, $120.
- **Worktree**: `auto`. **Sandbox**: `auto`.
- **Use when**: an item can be phrased as one feature with a
  clear "done" state.

Example `args` payload for a roadmap_item:
```json
{"feature_prompt": "Add a CSV-export button to the reports page that POSTs to /api/export and saves to ~/Downloads. Include a Playwright test."}
```

### `whole_improve_loop`

- **Path**: `examples/bots/whole_improve_loop.bot` (formerly
  `vibe_review_alternating`).
- **Vars**: `workspace_dir` (default), `scope_notes: string=""`
  — free-text steering ("focus on auth and persistence",
  "ignore the studio"); `improvement_prompt: string=""` —
  optional axis override. Empty (default) uses the full
  production-ready grid; non-empty REPLACES the grid as the
  reviewer/fixer focus (e.g. `"Focus exclusively on
  observability: structured logs, traces, metrics, lost error
  signals."`).
- **Pipeline**: alternating Claude/GPT review → fix loop until
  two consecutive cross-family approvals (max 15 iterations).
  No auto-commit — edits land in the working tree, operator
  commits.
- **Budget**: 1 branch, 2h, $60.
- **Use when**: existing code, operator wants rigorous
  production-readiness audit across the whole codebase, or
  wants to drive iterative improvement on a specific axis.

### `branch_improve_loop`

- **Path**: `examples/bots/branch_improve_loop.bot`.
- **Vars**: `workspace_dir` (default), `scope_notes: string=""`,
  `base_ref: string="main"` — branch comparison base. The
  bot reviews the diff `git diff base_ref...HEAD` only.
- **Pipeline**: same alternating Claude/GPT review/fix loop as
  `whole_improve_loop`, but scoped to the branch footprint;
  on cross-family convergence, `prepare_commit` + the
  `commit_changes` tool write a semantic commit covering the
  improvements applied. Runs in a `worktree: auto` so the
  operator's main checkout is shielded; the worktree
  finalizer creates `iterion/run/<name>` and fast-forwards
  the current branch.
- **Budget**: 1 branch, 2h, $60.
- **Use when**: an existing branch/PR needs a rigorous
  production-readiness review + fix + commit before merge.
  Pass `--var base_ref=develop` (or another integration
  branch) when reviewing against a non-main base.

### `secured-renovacy`

- **Path**: `examples/secured-renovacy/main.bot` (or packed
  `examples/secured-renovacy.botz`).
- **Vars**: `scope: "patch"|"minor"|"patch,minor,major"`,
  `max_packages_per_run`, `major_policy:
  "skip"|"gate"|"attempt"`, `update_scope`. **Ask before
  running with `major_policy: "attempt"`**.
- **Budget**: 4 branches, 12h, $100, 500 iter, 5M tokens.
- **Use when**: dependency risk is the priority; CVE alerts;
  stale lockfiles.

### `doc-align`

- **Path**: `examples/doc-align/main.bot` (or packed
  `examples/doc-align.botz`).
- **Vars**: none required. Optional: `doc_globs` (default
  `README.md,docs/**/*.md,CLAUDE.md`), `go_comment_globs`
  (default empty — opt in to comment audits),
  `code_scope_globs`, `coverage_target_pct` (default `80`),
  `diff_since` (hint only — recently-changed code files to
  prioritise), `bundle_self_path` (auto-exclude when the bot
  is auditing its own source tree).
- **Pipeline**: deterministic `scan_docs` enumerates the doc
  footprint once → alternating Claude/GPT review/fix on docs
  only (fixer is forbidden to touch code logic — `.md` files
  + Go comments only) → `prepare_commit` + `commit_changes`.
  A mechanical coverage gate (`cumulative_audited_docs /
  doc_count ≥ coverage_target_pct`) is baked into
  `streak_check` to prevent early "approved" on partial
  audits.
- **Budget**: 1 branch, 2h, $60 (typical).
- **Use when**: README / CLAUDE.md / `docs/**/*.md` / bundled
  skills are stale vs the code; before a release when the
  docs must reflect what shipped; whenever `repo-survey`
  flags drift between what the code does and what the docs
  claim.

## Issue-creation mapping (consumed by `emit_action`)

Each `roadmap_item` → one `iterion issue create` invocation:

```
roadmap_item.title    → --title
roadmap_item.body     → --body
roadmap_item.assignee → --assignee
roadmap_item.args     → --field bot_args=<flat string list>

horizon=next_action  → --labels horizon:next-action,source:whats-next
horizon=short_term   → --labels horizon:short-term,source:whats-next
horizon=long_term    → --labels horizon:long-term,source:whats-next
```

`bot_args` is a comma-joined flat string list. For
`args={"feature_prompt":"Add CSV export"}`, the field value is
`--var,feature_prompt=Add CSV export`. The eventual dispatcher
router will split on `,` and emit `--var` flags to the
dispatched bot.

## Verification ritual (emit_action)

Before creating each issue:

1. If `assignee != ""`, look it up in the table above. If it's
   not one of the five known bots (`vibe_feature_dev`,
   `whole_improve_loop`, `branch_improve_loop`,
   `secured-renovacy`, `doc-align`), AND it doesn't correspond
   to a `.bot` file the explorer surfaced — strip to `""` and
   add label `needs-manual-triage`. NEVER invent.
2. Empty assignee is FINE. The issue lands without an assignee
   and the operator triages.

## What you do NOT do

- You do NOT shell out `iterion run …` directly. The bot used
  to do that; it doesn't anymore.
- You do NOT enumerate bots from the user's free-text alone.
  Walk the decision tree against the explore summary.
- You do NOT recommend an `assignee` whose `.bot` file the
  explorer did not surface.
- You do NOT recommend more than one `next_action`.
