# Documentation

Welcome to the Iterion docs. Pages are organised by audience and topic.

## Background

| Page | Read this if… |
|---|---|
| [why-iterion.md](why-iterion.md) | …you want the origin story, the patterns we've seen work, the asymptote lens that motivated the engine, and the workflow-lab dimension. Helps you decide whether Iterion fits how you work. |
| [why-not-prompt-orchestration.md](why-not-prompt-orchestration.md) | …you're wondering whether a single Claude Code (or similar) session calling sub-agents could replace Iterion. Lays out the structural guarantees a compiled IR provides and the three-question heuristic for choosing between the two approaches. |
| [asymptote-bench.md](asymptote-bench.md) | …you want to measure a workflow's inter-session reliability curve via `iterion bench asymptote`. |

## Getting started

| Page | Read this if… |
|---|---|
| [install.md](install.md) | …you want to install Iterion. Covers all seven delivery modes (CLI, web editor, desktop, Docker, cloud, dispatcher, SDK). |
| [visual-editor.md](visual-editor.md) | …you want a browser-based drag-and-drop workflow editor. |
| [desktop.md](desktop.md) | …you want the native window app with multi-project + OS keychain + auto-update. |
| [examples.md](examples.md) | …you want to learn from working `.bot` files. |
| [skill.md](skill.md) | …you want your AI coding agent (Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot…) to author workflows for you. |

## Authoring `.bot` workflows

## Running and operating

| Page | Topic |
|---|---|

| [observability/README.md](observability/README.md) | Prometheus metrics, OTLP traces, Grafana dashboards. |
| [persisted-formats.md](persisted-formats.md) | On-disk format spec for `run.json`, `events.jsonl`, artifacts, interactions. |

## Cloud platform (Bot-as-a-Service)

Iterion ships as a self-hostable multi-tenant platform — orgs + teams,
BYOK LLM keys, inbound webhooks for 4 forges, NATS-queued runner pool,
per-org quotas, audit log, PATs, SMTP onboarding. We call it
**Bot-as-a-Service** (BaaS).

| Page | Topic |
|---|---|
| [baas-overview.md](baas-overview.md) | Start here — the event → autonomous agent → result-posted-back loop, a concrete GitLab-MR → Revi walkthrough, the primitives table. |
| [webhooks.md](webhooks.md) | Inbound webhooks (GitLab + `/revi`, GitHub, Forgejo/Gitea, generic) — auth modes, idempotency, CRUD API. |
| [forge-integrations.md](forge-integrations.md) | Connect a GitLab/GitHub/Forgejo repo (OAuth/PAT) and auto-provision the webhook + token binding when you enable a bot — the self-serve replacement for the manual webhook chain. |
| [quotas-and-limits.md](quotas-and-limits.md) | Run/cost/concurrency/rate caps, denial reasons + HTTP semantics, Prometheus metrics. |
| [baas-admin-guide.md](baas-admin-guide.md) | Platform operator + org admin runbook (UI paths + curl), DLQ triage, audit, PATs. |
| [secrets-reference.md](secrets-reference.md) | The single map of every secret kind (BYOK, generic, bindings, file, OAuth-forfait, tokens) and the sealing model. |
| [cloud-rest-api.md](cloud-rest-api.md) | Every REST endpoint grouped by domain, auth class, purpose. |
| [memory-and-knowledge.md](memory-and-knowledge.md) | Memory visibilities, per-org + per-space quotas, REST surface. |
