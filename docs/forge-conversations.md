# Forge conversations — replying to the bot (GitLab notes → run → in-thread reply)

How an authorized forge user "talks back" to a bot (reply to its review,
ask a question, or `/revi` for a re-review) and gets a response **in the
same discussion thread**. This is the conversational layer on top of the
auto-review webhook spine. It reuses three patterns already in the tree —
the webhook override model ([byok.md](byok.md)), the capability model
(`board.*`), and runtime input injection (`RepoURL`/`RepoSHA`) — so the
DSL stays small.

Status: A1 (note parsing), A2 (handler + authz + loop-guard +
reply-in-thread trigger), A3 (conversation vars incl. the fetched thread
transcript as `thread_context`) and A5 (`revi-converse`) are shipped.
A4 (`forge.reply` capability) is the remaining deferred step — the reply
POST is skill-based (`curl`) until then.

## Model — stateless, the thread is the state

A reply fires a forge `note` webhook → iterion authorizes the replier →
launches **one short run** carrying the thread context → the bot reads the
thread + the diff and posts a reply **in the same discussion**. The
conversation state lives in the GitLab thread (the source of truth), **not**
in a paused run. Each reply = one idempotent, recoverable run. That is the
durability win: no `paused_waiting_human` runs held open across hundreds of
MRs.

> **Why not `interaction: human`?** Tempting (bot posts → run pauses → a
> GitLab reply resumes it), but it holds the run open indefinitely, needs a
> reply→run_id map, and is stateful (1 run = 1 conversation). Stateless
> reply-as-new-run is more robust for an event-driven, multi-MR system.
> `interaction: llm_or_human` stays useful for a different thing — the bot
> deciding to **escalate** to a real human.

## A2 — Webhook layer: note events + trigger + loop-guard

`pkg/webhooks/gitlab/note.go` (done) parses the `Note Hook`: `discussion_id`
(the thread to reply in), `note.body`, the author (`User`), and the MR
context. `ParsedNote.Command()` extracts a leading `/revi …` command;
`IsMergeRequestNote()` filters out issue/commit notes; `SubjectID()` is
`note:<id>` for idempotency.

The handler (`pkg/server/webhooks_gitlab.go`, dispatch on
`X-Gitlab-Event`):
1. A webhook opts into notes by adding `"note"` to its `event_allowlist`
   (default stays `merge_request`-only — safe).
2. **Loop guard (critical):** skip notes whose author is the bot itself
   (else the bot's reply re-triggers a run → infinite loop). Resolve the
   bot's forge user once from the forge_token (`GET /user`) and compare
   `author_id`; cache it per webhook.
3. **Trigger gate:** a note triggers when it is a `/revi` command, a
   mention of the bot, or a reply inside a bot-authored discussion thread
   (configurable; `/revi` is the explicit path, reply-in-thread the
   natural one).
4. Idempotency on `note:<id>`; `MatchProject` as for MR events.

## A2 — Authorization (the heart): two separate things

Do **not** conflate:
- **Who may trigger** = the *replier's* authorization (the GitLab user).
- **Under whose identity the bot posts** = the `forge_token` (the org
  binding, or the per-webhook secret override from [byok.md](byok.md)).

A replier is authorized when **(role-gate) OR (allowlist)**:
- **Role-gate (default):** the author has at least `min_replier_role`
  (e.g. Developer) on the project — checked via the forge API
  (`GET /projects/{id}/members/all/{user_id}` → `access_level`) using the
  resolved `forge_token`. Reuses GitLab's own permissions ("if you can
  push, you can talk to the bot") — no list to maintain.
- **Allowlist (explicit):** the author's username/id is in an explicit
  list — for collaborators who lack the role but should be allowed.

Both live at **org-default + per-webhook override**, exactly like the BYOK
key/secret overrides:
- `webhooks.Config.AuthorizedRepliers []string` (+ `MinReplierRole`)
  override the org-level defaults (a team setting).
- Validation/precedence mirror `validateKeyOverrides` /
  `validateSecretOverrides`.

An unauthorized note → `200 filtered`, no run (and an audit row).

## A3 — Conversation context (runtime injection, like RepoURL)

The webhook/runtime injects a standard structured input the way it injects
`RepoURL`/`RepoSHA`: a `Conversation` on `runview.LaunchSpec` →
`store.Run` (persisted for resume) → `queue.RunMessage` →
the engine vars. Fields: `thread_id` (discussion), `trigger_note`,
`replier` (username), `mr_url`, and optionally the fetched thread history.
Any bot becomes conversational with no per-bot plumbing — it just reads
`{{conversation.*}}`.

**Shipped (vars-level):** the handler injects `discussion_id`,
`trigger_note`, `trigger_command`/`trigger_args`, `replier` and — on the
converse route — `converse_question` plus `thread_context`, the discussion
transcript fetched from the forge API (chronological, the bot's own notes
labelled, capped at ~16k chars keeping the thread anchor + the newest
notes; see `gitlab.FormatThreadTranscript`). The gate fetches the
discussion ONCE and reuses it for both the reply-in-thread classification
and the transcript. The dedicated `Conversation` struct on `LaunchSpec`
(vs plain vars) remains the refactor to do when a second forge needs it.

## A4 — `forge.reply` capability (the DSL answer)

The DSL footprint is a **capability**, sibling of `board.create/move/read`
— not a new node type and not an `interaction:` mode. A bot declares
`capabilities: [forge.reply]` and the runtime opens a `forge_reply(thread_id,
body)` tool that posts in-thread via the `forge_token`, handling the forge
API + the bot identity + anti-replay. iterion controls the posting (vs raw
`curl` in a skill). Wire it like the board capability: an in-process claw
tool (`pkg/backend/tool/`) + the claude_code MCP path
(`__mcp-*` / HTTP), gated by the capability. Capability diagnostics extend
the C080–C082 family.

(The review-posting in `review-pr` can stay skill-based for now and migrate
to `forge.*` capabilities over time; the *reply* path starts capability-first
because it is short and security-sensitive.)

## A5 — The conversational bot

A `revi-converse` mode/bot (or a `reply` entry of `review-pr`): reads the
thread (`{{conversation.*}}`) + the diff, answers the user's note (or
re-reviews on `/revi`), and calls `forge_reply`. Reuses the
`forge-pr-review` skill family.

## Build order

A1 note parsing ✓ · A2 handler + auth (role-gate + allowlist, org-default +
per-webhook override) + loop-guard · A3 conversation injection · A4
`forge.reply` capability/tool · A5 `revi-converse` bot. Each is incremental
on the existing spine; A2 is the core (events + authorization).
