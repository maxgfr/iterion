# C082 board-emit fix — implementation plan

Status: **RESOLVED + live-validated end-to-end (2026-06-14).** A sandboxed
`claude_code` agent now reaches the per-run board MCP listener over HTTP and
its `create_issue` call lands on the operator's board (validated: board count
0→1, real native id, fetchable, `run finished`). Branch: `c082-board-emit`
(worktree off local HEAD). See "Resolution" at the bottom for the actual root
cause — it was **not** any of the hypotheses in the design below (https-only /
tool-search deferral / session-id), but a **missing `serverInfo.version`** field
in the handler's `initialize` response that made claude-code's MCP client
Zod-reject the whole connection.

## Symptom

Sandboxed `sec-audit-source` (Seki) `report_card` (backend `claude_code`) calls
`board.create` ×3, its output carries native-looking IDs (`native:90543c66…`),
but **nothing lands on the operator's board** (run 019ec230: board total stayed
94; fetch-by-id + every label query miss). The agent **confabulated** the IDs.

## Root cause (verified in code)

The sandboxed board MCP HTTP transport is **declared on both ends but the
producer side is never connected**:

- **Consumer exists**: [pkg/backend/delegate/claude_code.go:477](../pkg/backend/delegate/claude_code.go)
  uses `task.BoardHTTPEndpoint` + `task.BoardRunToken`; :490 warns + **disables
  board MCP** when they're empty under a sandbox.
- **Server exists**: [pkg/server/mcp_board_handler.go](../pkg/server/mcp_board_handler.go)
  (`BoardMCPTokenRegistry`, `RegisterBoardMCPRoutes`) + server.go:870 wires
  `/api/v1/mcp/board`.
- **Producer MISSING**: grep shows **nothing ever assigns
  `Task.BoardHTTPEndpoint`/`BoardRunToken`** and **nothing ever calls
  `boardMCPTokens.Register(token, caps)`** for a run. So claude_code always hits
  the :490 "board MCP disabled" path → no board tool → confabulation.

## Why not the simpler stdio-to-mounted-store route

Non-sandboxed claude_code uses the `__mcp-board` **stdio** server (writes the
board store directly). In a sandbox the store *is* visible (the workspace
`.iterion/dispatcher` is bind-mounted), so a stdio `__mcp-board` inside the
container could write it — BUT [pkg/dispatcher/native/store.go:40](../pkg/dispatcher/native/store.go)
guards writes with only an **in-process `sync.Mutex`** (no flock). The studio
process and an in-container process are **different processes** → concurrent
`board.json` writes would corrupt it. The HTTP transport exists precisely to
**serialize all writes through the one studio process's Store**. So the fix must
stay HTTP.

## The networking constraint

`iterion studio` binds **127.0.0.1** (loopback). The container cannot reach
`127.0.0.1` (that's the container itself) and `host.docker.internal:4891` →
gateway IP → a 127.0.0.1-bound server isn't listening there. (The egress proxy
works only because the docker driver's `ProxyConfigurer` binds it
gateway-reachable — see [pkg/runtime/sandbox.go:422](../pkg/runtime/sandbox.go)
`proxyAddressesForDriver` + :318 `startNetworkProxy`.) `NO_PROXY` also contains
`127.0.0.1`, so routing board calls through the proxy to loopback won't work
either. The board endpoint therefore needs its **own gateway-reachable bind**.

## Design

Start a **per-run gateway-reachable board MCP listener** alongside the egress
proxy in the sandbox-start path, serving the board routes against the **same
in-process `native.Store` instance** the studio uses (so the Store mutex
serializes container writes with studio writes — no corruption).

1. **Resolve the import cycle.** `pkg/runtime` cannot import `pkg/server`
   (server → runview → runtime). The board MCP HTTP handler + token registry
   currently live in `pkg/server`. Options:
   - **(preferred)** Relocate `RegisterBoardMCPRoutes` + `BoardMCPTokenRegistry`
     + the handler to a neutral package (e.g. `pkg/dispatcher/native/boardmcp`
     or extend `pkg/dispatcher/native/boardops`) that both `pkg/server` and
     `pkg/runtime` import. `pkg/server` keeps a thin wrapper for back-compat.
   - **(alt)** Pass a `StartBoardListener func(caps []string) (endpoint, token
     string, stop func(), err error)` **closure** from `pkg/server` into the
     runtime via `SandboxParams`; the closure (server-side) registers the token
     + serves the routes, but it still needs the driver's gateway bind from
     runtime → awkward. Relocation is cleaner.

2. **Plumb the store + token registry to the sandbox-start.** Add to
   [SandboxParams](../pkg/runtime/sandbox.go) (~line 136): `BoardStore
   *native.Store` + `BoardTokens *boardmcp.TokenRegistry` (neutral types, no
   server import). The server populates them when constructing the
   Engine/executor for a studio run (it has `s.cfg.NativeTrackerStore` +
   `s.boardMCPTokens`). CLI runs leave them nil → behaviour unchanged (board
   caps stay disabled under sandbox; documented).

3. **Start the listener in `resolveAndStartSandbox`** (after the proxy, ~line
   239), only when `p.BoardStore != nil` AND the workflow has any board-cap
   node AND the driver is real (not noop). Bind gateway-reachable via the same
   `proxyAddressesForDriver(driver)` mechanism the proxy uses (`127.0.0.1:0`
   bind + `host.docker.internal` advertise on docker). Serve
   `RegisterBoardMCPRoutes(mux, "/", BoardStore, BoardTokens)`. Return its
   advertised endpoint + a `stop func()` (shut it down in the sandbox cleanup
   alongside the proxy).

4. **Register a per-run token + set the Task fields.** The executor, when
   building a Task for a node with board caps under a sandbox
   ([executor.go ~1245](../pkg/backend/model/executor.go)), calls
   `BoardTokens.Register(token, caps)` and sets `task.BoardHTTPEndpoint =
   <listener endpoint>/` + `task.BoardRunToken = token`. The endpoint must reach
   the executor — thread it from the active sandbox (the Engine already holds
   the `activeSandbox`; expose its board endpoint to the executor like it does
   `e.sandbox`).

## Validation (must be live — container reachability)

- Build the worktree binary (`CGO_ENABLED=0`).
- Run a **dedicated** `iterion server --store-dir <tmp> --port <P>` from the
  worktree binary, bound so the docker gateway can reach it (the per-run
  listener handles this; the main server bind is irrelevant to the listener).
- Launch Seki sandboxed against it (`enable_deepsec=false`, `remediate=false`)
  via its API; on `report_card`, assert the board **total increases** and the
  created issue is fetchable by id/label. This proves the container reached the
  gateway listener and the write serialized into the shared Store.
- Negative check: confirm CLI runs (no server) still disable board caps under
  sandbox cleanly (no confabulation regression — ideally the agent gets a tool
  that errors honestly rather than a missing tool it confabulates around;
  consider surfacing the :490 disable as a hard "board unavailable" tool result).

## Files touched (estimate)

- `pkg/dispatcher/native/boardmcp/` (new, relocated handler+registry) or
  `pkg/dispatcher/native/boardops`.
- `pkg/server/mcp_board_handler.go` + `server.go` (thin wrapper / populate
  SandboxParams).
- `pkg/runtime/sandbox.go` (SandboxParams fields + listener start/stop) + the
  Engine→executor board-endpoint exposure.
- `pkg/backend/model/executor.go` (Task builder: register token + set fields).
- Tests: a unit test for the token-register+Task-field wiring; the live
  sandboxed run for end-to-end.

## Interim mitigation (optional, cheap)

Until the listener lands, make the confabulation **honest**: when board caps are
granted under a sandbox but `BoardHTTPEndpoint` is empty, claude_code should
expose a board tool that returns an explicit "board unavailable in this run"
error rather than no tool (the agent then can't confabulate created IDs). This
turns a silent data-loss into a visible degradation.

## Validation findings (2026-06-14) — iterion-side layers (all ✅)

Implemented on this branch (parts 1–4) and live-validated each iterion-side layer
in isolation via a dedicated studio (worktree binary, port 4899, isolated store)
running a minimal sandboxed claude_code board.create bot. (The final missing
piece was in the handler's `initialize` response, not in any of these layers —
see "Resolution" below.)

1. **Gateway listener** — starts per run: `board MCP listener on
   http://host.docker.internal:<port>/api/v1/mcp/board`. ✅
2. **Producer wiring** — claude is exec'd with the correct inline
   `--mcp-config {"mcpServers":{"iterion_board":{"type":"http","url":...,
   "headers":{"X-Iterion-Run":...}}}}`. ✅
3. **Inline MCP config** (part 3) — fixed `MCP config file not found` (host /tmp
   file invisible to the container); config now passed as an inline JSON string. ✅
4. **NO_PROXY + proxy host.docker.internal→loopback** (parts 3–4) — a container
   reaches a host `0.0.0.0` listener via `host.docker.internal` directly (verified
   with a controlled `docker run` curl). ✅
5. **Handler MCP protocol** — `initialize` + `tools/list` return correct responses
   with `Content-Type: application/json` (verified via curl against the live
   endpoint with a real token). ✅

Earlier this section listed a "remaining gap" attributing the non-registration to
claude-code's own MCP client (suspecting session-id / SSE / protocol-version /
https-only). That diagnosis was incomplete: the client *did* attempt the connect
and failed on a response-shape validation — see below.

## Resolution (2026-06-14) — actual root cause + the closing fixes

The https-only / TLS hypothesis above was **wrong** (kept for the record; do not
act on it). Enabling claude-code's own MCP debug — env-gated `--debug mcp`
passthrough → logs under `CLAUDE_CODE_DEBUG_LOGS_DIR` — captured the real
behaviour against the LIVE per-run listener:

```
MCP server "iterion_board": Testing basic HTTP connectivity to http://host.docker.internal:<port>/api/v1/mcp/board
MCP server "iterion_board": HTTP Connection failed after 9ms: [{
  "expected":"string","code":"invalid_type","path":["serverInfo","version"],
  "message":"Invalid input: expected string, received undefined" }]
$ZodError: ... serverInfo.version ...
```

claude-code **connected fine over plain HTTP** (so: not https-only, not a
reachability problem, not deferral) — it then **validated the `initialize`
response with a Zod schema that requires `serverInfo.version` to be a string**,
and our handler returned only `serverInfo:{name:"iterion-board-http"}` (no
`version`). The missing field made the client reject the *entire* connection, so
`iterion_board` never registered and the agent confabulated board ids (C082).

### The two closing fixes

1. **`serverInfo.version` (THE fix).** [pkg/server/mcp_board_handler.go](../pkg/server/mcp_board_handler.go)
   `initialize` now returns `serverInfo:{name,version:"1.0.0"}`. Guarded by
   `TestBoardMCP_HTTP_InitializeServerInfoVersion`. After this alone the debug log
   flips to `Successfully connected (transport: http) in 13ms` /
   `Connection established with capabilities: {"hasTools":true,...}`.
2. **`alwaysLoad:true` on the board MCP server** (belt-and-suspenders).
   [pkg/backend/delegate/claudesdk/mcp.go](../pkg/backend/delegate/claudesdk/mcp.go)
   `MCPHTTPServer.AlwaysLoad` → `"alwaysLoad":true` in the `--mcp-config` JSON;
   set in [pkg/backend/delegate/claude_code.go](../pkg/backend/delegate/claude_code.go).
   Exempts the board server from claude-code's tool-search deferral so a board-cap
   node reliably *sees* `mcp__iterion_board__*` without a ToolSearch hit, and forces
   connect-at-startup so a misconfig fails loudly instead of silently deferring.

### Secondary finding — `--debug <value>` breaks `--print --input-format stream-json`

The diagnostic `ITERION_CLAUDE_DEBUG=mcp` → `--debug mcp` passthrough I added to
capture the logs **must not ship**: claude-code consumes the `--debug` *value* as
a positional prompt argument, which conflicts with `--input-format stream-json`
and makes the CLI exit 1 with `Input must be provided either through stdin or as a
prompt argument when using --print`. Proven empirically: identical binary/bot/
config, the run **fails** with `ITERION_CLAUDE_DEBUG` set and **succeeds**
(board lands) without it. The passthrough has been **reverted**. To re-capture MCP
debug in future, set `CLAUDE_CODE_DEBUG_LOGS_DIR` and pass `--debug=mcp` (equals
form, so the value isn't taken as positional) — or run the `claude` CLI directly,
not through the stream-json delegate path.

### End-to-end validation (live)

Dedicated worktree studio (fresh static binary, isolated store `/tmp/c082val`),
minimal sandboxed `claude_code` `create_issue` bot against the
`iterion-sandbox-sec:edge` image: `mcp__iterion_board__create_issue` was invoked,
the board total went **0 → 1**, the issue is fetchable by its real native id
(`native:1714f23b…`, state `inbox`), and the run **finished**. The full producer
chain — gateway listener → inline `--mcp-config` → NO_PROXY/proxy-resolve →
`serverInfo.version` → `alwaysLoad` — is now proven, not just verified in isolation.
