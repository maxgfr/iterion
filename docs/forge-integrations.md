# Forge integrations (connect a repo, auto-provision)

**Audience.** Org admins who want to wire a GitLab/GitHub/Forgejo repo to a
bot (e.g. Revi on merge-request open) without the manual
PAT→secret→binding→webhook→forge-hook chain.

This is the **outbound** complement of [inbound webhooks](webhooks.md):
inbound (`pkg/webhooks`) authenticates deliveries the forge sends *to*
iterion; forge integrations (`pkg/forge`) hold the admin credential that
lets iterion call *out* to the forge to register that delivery — and the
bot-secret binding — in one action.

## What it does

In the studio, **`/teams/<id>` → Integrations**:

1. **Connect a forge** once — OAuth (when an OAuth app is configured) or
   paste a personal access token (the fallback, and the only path for
   self-hosted instances with no registrable OAuth app). iterion validates
   the token (`GET /user`), reads the identity, and stores the credential
   **sealed**.
2. **Enable a repo** — pick a repo the credential can administer, check the
   forge-capable bots (each shows the events it subscribes to + its manifest
   rationale), and click Enable. In one server action iterion:
   - derives a team-scoped **managed `forge_token`** secret from the
     connection (created once per connection);
   - creates (or extends) the iterion **webhook config** for that repo, with
     a fresh `iwh_` secret it holds on both ends, the events the bots need,
     and a per-webhook `SecretOverrides` pin to the managed token;
   - calls the forge API to **create the webhook** on the repo pointing at
     iterion's inbound URL with that `iwh_` secret;
   - records a **`RepoIntegration`** join row.

Disable is the inverse, one click: delete the forge hook, the webhook
config, and the join row (the managed secret survives — it is shared by the
connection's other repos; it is removed when the connection is deleted).

## What a bot declares (`forge:` in its manifest)

A bot opts into auto-provisioning with a `forge:` block in its
`manifest.yaml` — advisory, discovery-time metadata (like `dispatch_vars`),
read by the orchestrator, not the runtime:

```yaml
forge:
  events: [pull_request, pull_request_comment]  # normalized; mapped per provider
  token_scopes:
    pull_requests: write
    repository: read
  secret: forge_token            # the workflow-secret name the bot consumes
  webhook:
    launch_vars: { pr_review_mode: summary }
    min_replier_role: developer
  rationale: |
    Shown in the enable dialog so the operator sees why each scope is asked.
```

Normalized event vocabulary (mapped to the forge's native names by
[pkg/forge/event_map.go](../pkg/forge/event_map.go)):

| normalized | GitLab | GitHub | Forgejo |
|---|---|---|---|
| `pull_request` | `merge_requests_events` | `pull_request` | `pull_request` |
| `pull_request_comment` | `note_events` | `issue_comment` | `issue_comment` |

Unknown events / scope keys / levels fail manifest parsing
([pkg/bundle/manifest.go:validateForgeRequirements](../pkg/bundle/manifest.go)).

## The managed-token design (why the downstream is unchanged)

The connection's admin token (OAuth user token / installation token / PAT)
is used **only** to manage iterion's footprint on the forge — create hooks,
list repos. It is **never** what a bot posts with. Instead the orchestrator
derives a managed, team-scoped `forge_token` generic secret from it and pins
it on the webhook via `SecretOverrides` (Tier-0 in
`ResolveGenericWithBindings`). So the entire existing run path —
`forge_token` → `RunBundle` → `/run/iterion/secrets/forge_token` →
`glab`/`gh` — is **unchanged**. OAuth/App tokens are kept fresh by a
background worker ([pkg/forge/refresh.go](../pkg/forge/refresh.go)) that
re-seals the connection blob, then rewrites the managed secret's plaintext;
PAT connections never refresh.

## Configuration (cloud)

The Mongo stores (`forge_connections`, `repo_integrations`) and the routes
are wired automatically in `iterion server` cloud mode. OAuth apps are
opt-in per provider via env (a provider with no client id offers only the
PAT path):

```
ITERION_FORGE_GITLAB_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID / _CLIENT_SECRET
ITERION_FORGE_GITHUB_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID / _CLIENT_SECRET   (Phase 3)
ITERION_FORGE_FORGEJO_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID / _CLIENT_SECRET  (Phase 4)
```

`PublicURL` must be set (the OAuth redirect + the forge hook URL are built
from it).

## Security envelopes

- Connection tokens are sealed with AAD `forge_conn:<id>`; the managed
  secret keeps the existing `generic_secret:<id>` AAD; the GitHub-App
  private key (Phase 2) lives in deployment config, never in Mongo. No token
  is ever logged or placed in a URL.
- `Connection.ForgeBaseURL` is threaded onto `webhooks.Config.ForgeBaseURL`
  so the existing inbound SSRF host-pin keeps applying; the global
  `ITERION_WEBHOOK_FORGE_HOSTS` allowlist still wins.
- The `iwh_` webhook secret is minted server-side and **never shown to the
  operator** — iterion holds both ends. A fresh one is minted on every
  mutating provision so the forge hook secret and the iterion config hash
  stay in lockstep without needing the prior plaintext.
- Insufficient scope (the token can't create a hook) surfaces as a
  structured `insufficient_scope` 403 so the studio can prompt to reconnect
  with broader scope or paste a PAT.

## API

All under `/api/teams/{id}/forge/` (admin/owner), except the OAuth callback
which is a public IdP redirect target authenticated by signed state + an
agent-binding cookie:

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/connections` | list connections |
| POST | `/connections` | connect (`mode: pat` \| `oauth`) → `{connection}` or `{authorize_url}` |
| DELETE | `/connections/{conn_id}` | disconnect (deprovisions every repo first) |
| GET | `/connections/{conn_id}/repos?search=&page=` | repo picker (admin-capable only) |
| GET | `/api/forge/oauth/callback` | **public** OAuth redirect target |
| GET | `/repo-bots` | list active integrations |
| GET | `/repo-bots/preview?connection_id=&repo=&bots=` | events + scopes + conflicts, no writes |
| POST | `/repo-bots` | enable `{connection_id, repo, bot_ids}` → `ProvisionResult` |
| DELETE | `/repo-bots/{integration_id}` | disable |

## Provider support

| Provider | OAuth | PAT | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| GitLab | ✅ | ✅ | live ([pkg/forge/gitlab](../pkg/forge/gitlab)) |
| GitHub App | — | — | Phase 2 (planned) |
| GitHub OAuth App | — | — | Phase 3 (planned) |
| Forgejo / Gitea | — | — | Phase 4 (planned) |

Adding a provider = implement the `forge.Admin` interface (+ an
`OAuthExchanger`/`TokenRefresher` for OAuth) and register it in the server's
provider dispatch; the orchestrator + studio are provider-agnostic.
