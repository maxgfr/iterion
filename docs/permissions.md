# Tool-permission gate (anti-prompt-injection)

iterion's permission gate restores Claude Code's default **"ask before
acting"** posture to iterion workflows — and brings it to the **claw**
backend too, so claude_code and claw reach **identical** decisions.

## Why

By default every `claude_code` and `claw` node runs effectively in
**bypassPermissions**: any tool the model decides to call executes
unconditionally. That is convenient but it is also the posture a
prompt-injection or "hypnosis" attack relies on — a poisoned web page,
a malicious file, or a confused chain of reasoning can get the agent to
exfiltrate a secret, `curl` an attacker, `rm -rf` a tree, or `git push`
to a rogue remote, and nothing stops it.

The gate makes the operator's **allow-list the frame of what's
authorized**, evaluated by deterministic code **outside the model's
controllable surface** (`pkg/backend/permission`). Anything off-frame is
denied, or surfaced to a human — exactly like Claude Code's `canUseTool`
default. The model cannot talk its way past a rule, because the rules
are not part of its context.

This mirrors the official Anthropic model (Agent SDK *Configure
permissions* + *Handle approvals and user input*): tool calls are
evaluated **deny rules → ask rules → allow rules → mode default**, and
unmatched calls fall through to human approval.

## Modes

Set on the `workflow` block, per node, the CLI, or the environment.
**Opt-in: the default is `off`** — existing bots are unchanged.

| iterion `permission:` | Claude Code analog | Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `off` (default) | `bypassPermissions` | No gate (today's behavior). |
| `ask` | `default` | allow-rules auto-approve; **deny**-rules hard-block; everything else **pauses the run and surfaces the call to the human** (resumable). |
| `deny` | `dontAsk` | allow-rules approve; everything else is **hard-denied with no pause** — the policy boundary for headless / cloud / cron runs with no human attached. |

## Rule syntax

Rules use Claude Code's syntax — a bare tool name matches any use, or a
scoped `Tool(pattern)` matches an argument:

Rule lists use iterion's inline-array syntax (like `capabilities:`):

```
workflow main:
  permission: ask
  allow: ["Read(**)", "Edit(pkg/**)", "Bash(go test:*)", "Grep", "mcp__github__get_*"]
  ask:   ["Bash(git push:*)"]
  deny:  ["Bash(rm -rf:*)", "Read(.env*)", "WebFetch(domain:evil.example)"]
```

Where:

- `Read(**)` — read anything; `Edit(pkg/**)` — edit only under `pkg/`.
- `Bash(go test:*)` — any `go test …` command (`:*` = prefix match).
- `Grep` (bare) — any grep; `mcp__github__get_*` — any github MCP `get_` tool.
- `Bash(rm -rf:*)` in `deny:` — never `rm -rf`, even in `ask` mode.

A per-node override is the scalar mode only — `permission: deny` on an
`agent` or `judge` node (the gate evaluates *LLM-issued* tool calls; a
`tool` node's `permission:` is parsed but currently inert — see Status).

Matching semantics (`pkg/backend/permission`):

- **Bash** patterns match the `command`; `prefix:*` is a prefix match,
  a bare wildcard `*`/`**` is a greedy match, no wildcard is exact.
- **Read / Edit / Write / NotebookEdit** patterns match the file path;
  `pkg/**`, `*.go` etc. work as gitignore-style globs.
- **WebFetch** patterns match `domain:<host>`, `<host>`, or the full URL.
- **Tool-name globs**: `*` (any tool) and `mcp__<server>__*`.

**Cross-backend parity.** The same rule gates the matching tool on both
backends: a single `Bash(...)` rule covers claude_code's `Bash` and
claw's `bash`/`shell`; `Edit(...)` covers `Edit`/`edit_file`/`file_edit`;
`Read(...)` covers `Read`/`read_file`; etc. (see `canonicalToolName`).

**Infrastructure exemption.** iterion's own interaction/capability
plumbing — `ask_user`, the board / control / watch MCP families — is
never gated (or `ask` mode would pause on the very tool used to ask the
human).

## Precedence

Mode resolves with the same precedence as `rtk:`:

```
CLI --permission  >  node permission:  >  workflow permission:  >  ITERION_PERMISSION  >  off
```

Rule lists are **additive**: the workflow `allow:`/`ask:`/`deny:` lists
plus any `--permission-allow`/`--permission-ask`/`--permission-deny`
run-level rules.

## CLI

```bash
iterion run bot.bot --permission ask \
  --permission-allow 'Read(**)' --permission-allow 'Bash(go test:*)' \
  --permission-deny  'Bash(rm -rf:*)'

# Headless hard boundary (no human to pause for):
iterion run bot.bot --permission deny --permission-allow 'Read(**)'
```

Environment: `ITERION_PERMISSION=ask|deny|off`.

## How it works

The resolved `permission.Policy` is carried on `delegate.Task.Permission`
and evaluated by **both** backends before every tool runs:

- **claw** — `executeToolsDirect` (pkg/backend/model/generation.go)
  evaluates the policy before `gt.Execute`. Allow → execute; Deny → a
  synthetic `isError` tool_result the model adapts to; Ask → the loop
  aborts with `delegate.ErrAskUser` so the run pauses.
- **claude_code** — a broad PreToolUse hook (`wirePermissionHook` in
  claude_code.go) evaluates the policy. Under the always-on
  `bypassPermissions`, PreToolUse hooks still run and a `deny` decision
  still blocks the tool (Agent SDK order: hooks run first), so no
  `--permission-mode` change is needed. Ask reuses the `ask_user`
  capture-and-pause path.

Both honour the **same** `permission.Policy`, so a bot behaves
identically whichever backend executes it.

## Status / limitations

- **`off` and `deny` modes, and explicit `allow:`/`deny:` rules in any
  mode, are fully deterministic** and need no human — the complete
  anti-injection boundary for headless and cloud runs.
- **`ask` mode** pauses the run (`paused_waiting_human`) and surfaces the
  off-policy call to the operator, so nothing off-policy ever executes
  silently. To resolve the pause, the operator answers the approval
  question:
  - **claw** — the answer is interpreted directly: `allow` / `allow
    always` records a grant and the agent's re-issued call executes
    (`allow always` keeps it allowed for the rest of the run segment);
    `deny` refuses it and the agent adapts. No rule typing needed.
  - **claude_code** — resume with the matching `--permission-allow`
    rule (e.g. `iterion resume … --permission-allow 'Bash(go build:*)'`);
    the CLI session re-issues the now-authorized call. (The studio can
    offer this as a one-click button computed from the paused call.)
- Studio surfaces the paused approval request through the existing
  human-input UI; dedicated allow/deny buttons + a Launch-modal mode
  toggle are the remaining polish.
- **Scope:** the gate evaluates the **tool calls an agent/judge LLM
  makes**. A `tool` node (a direct, deterministic shell command, no LLM)
  is the action itself and is governed by the **Verified Action** quad
  (`goal`/`postcondition`/`policy`/`recovery`), not this gate — so a
  `permission:` mode on a `tool` node is currently reserved (parsed,
  not yet enforced).
