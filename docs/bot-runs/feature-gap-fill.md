# feature-gap-fill (Fini) — bilans

Gap-driven feature completer. A specialisation of feature_dev: the input is a
structured `gap_spec` ("here is what's implemented, here is what's missing"),
not a greenfield prompt. Fini reads the partial implementation, completes the
missing parts, runs the alternating Claude/GPT review-fix loop to convergence,
then commits. Inputs are typically the `type:feature-gap` issues filed by the
adr-cartograph (Adry) bot.

## 2026-06-14 — clone transport validation, SANDBOXED (run 019ec75f)

- **Status: validated** — Fini produced a real, correct, tested security fix
  from Adry's gap spec and converged cleanly. Independently verified (tests run
  on host).
- **Versions:** bot 0.1.0 · iterion @ `030031f6` (main)
- **Method:** `ITERION_OPENAI_USE_OAUTH=1 ./iterion run
  bots/feature-gap-fill/main.bot --var gap_spec='<08aaf4ef body>' --store-dir
  .iterion --merge-into none`. gap_spec = Adry's `bot-marketplace-shallow-clone`
  issue (`Add transport validation for bot marketplace shallow clone sources`).
  **Ran SANDBOXED** (`iterion-sandbox-full:edge`, `worktree: auto`) — unlike the
  019ec599 run which forced `--sandbox none`. Forfait forced.
- **Result: converged + committed.** survey_existing → plan → act → simplify →
  **2 review cycles** (reviewer_claude→streak_check→reviewer_gpt→streak_check,
  cross-family double-approval, **0 fixer iterations, no oscillation**) →
  prepare_commit → commit. **$3.52 / ~16 min / 58k tokens.** Committed
  `a7f44eb3` ("feat(git): gate git clone sources to safe https/ssh transports",
  **4 files +154/-2**) on storage branch `iterion/run/chrome-surge-scalarsmol-9428`.
  I reviewed + validated (`go test ./pkg/git ./pkg/botinstall` → ok) then
  FF-merged to main. Board 08aaf4ef → done.
- **Value: high — real security hardening.** `ValidateCloneSource`
  (pkg/git/safety.go) allowlists `https://`/`ssh://`/scp-like and rejects the
  `::` remote-helper marker (catches `ext::` arbitrary-command-exec) +
  `file://`/`git://`/`http://`/bare paths; `ShallowClone` now calls it (keeping
  `--` as flag-injection defense-in-depth). `clone_test.go` tests 6 accept + 12
  reject cases incl. the error-message acceptance criterion. Survey was
  excellent: found ADR-020 as the doc home, identified the HTTP marketplace
  routes as the actual untrusted surface, noted `ValidateRelPath`/
  `ValidateBranchName` pre-existed (stayed in scope).
- **Engine/forfait health:** clean run — **no `StructuredOutput: no such tool`
  error** (d8e8dde1 holding on schema+tools claude_code nodes), no forfait
  flakiness, no retries. **Sandboxed claude_code + reviewer_gpt (claw/forfait)
  both ran cleanly in-container** — the sandbox path is viable for Fini now
  (contrast the 019ec599 bilan's "host-mode until ~/.codex mounted" caveat).

### Findings / misses
- **Fini cannot run the test suite in-sandbox** (`devbox cache permission-denied`
  + host `go` can't fetch the 1.26.0 toolchain in the container). Reviewers
  approved by *reading* the diff; tests were never *executed* by Fini. So a
  human/CLI must `go test` on the host before merge (I did → pass). Known
  "devbox silently broken in sandbox" limitation.
- **08aaf4ef ↔ 50bbe258 interaction conflict (Adry gap-spec coupling).**
  50bbe258 asks to test `ShallowClone` hermetically via a `file://` URL — but
  08aaf4ef's new gate **rejects `file://`**, obsoleting that approach. The
  empty/whitespace-guard intent is now covered by `clone_test.go`
  (`ValidateCloneSource` is the guard); the actual-clone cases (with/without
  ref, stderr-wrap) can't be tested hermetically post-gate (would need a
  `cloneArgs(url,ref,dest)` extraction or a test seam). **50bbe258 needs
  re-scope; left in inbox, not run as-is.** Lesson: when Adry files multiple
  gap tickets on one function, one fix can invalidate another's approach.
- Good bot judgment on out-of-scope items: flagged `http://` rejection as a
  possible config need (internal cleartext servers) and the `go.mod` `yaml.v3`
  indirect→direct drift, both as *observations*, not scope creep.

## 2026-06-14 — first dogfood, file-diff size-cap gap (run 019ec599)

- **Status: validated** — Fini produced real, correct, tested code from a gap
  spec and converged cleanly. NOT a façade (verified independently).
- **Versions:** bot 0.1.0 · iterion @ `03f398e2` (main)
- **Method:** `iterion run bots/feature-gap-fill/main.bot --var gap_spec='<…>'
  --sandbox none --merge-into none`, gap_spec = the **file-diff-payload**
  issue Adry filed (`Cap file contents loaded for Monaco diff payloads`).
  Launched under `devbox run` with `~/.local/bin` on PATH so the host run had
  both `go` (devbox) and `claude` (host) — sandbox forced off because this
  worktree's engine predates the concurrent sandboxed-claw fixes and `~/.codex`
  (forfait) is not mounted into the container. `worktree: auto` still isolated
  the Go edits; forfait forced (`ITERION_OPENAI_USE_OAUTH=1`).
- **Result: converged + committed.** Flow: survey_existing → plan → act →
  simplify → reviewer_claude + reviewer_gpt **both approved cross-family on the
  first pass (0 fixer iterations)** → prepare_commit → commit_changes → done
  (~18 min, 12:07→12:25). Committed `88943d4b` ("feat(git): cap diff payload
  reads to avoid OOM on oversized files", **5 files, +267/-30**) on the
  storage branch `iterion/run/magneto-whomp-etherspark-4f0a` — **NOT on main**
  (`--merge-into none`), preserved for human review. The engine recorded
  `final_commit` + `final_branch` and removed the worktree cleanly.
- **Value: high — a genuine OOM fix.** The implementation is substantive and
  correct: an `errOversized` sentinel + `diffPayloadCap` (reuses
  `untrackedReadCap`'s 5 MiB), the reading primitives (`readWorktreeFile`,
  `showAt`) return oversized **before** loading the blob into memory, both
  sides blanked + `Oversized=true`, oversize-wins-over-binary — meeting all the
  issue's acceptance criteria. It also ADDED `pkg/git/diff_test.go` (160 lines:
  `TestDiffOversizedWorktree`, `TestDiffOversizedHead`), exactly as the
  acceptance criteria required.
- **Anti-façade verification:** I checked out `88943d4b` into a throwaway
  worktree and ran `go build ./pkg/git/` + `go test ./pkg/git/` independently
  → **builds clean, tests pass** (`ok 1.162s`). Real work, not a reported
  parity façade.
- **Pipeline validated:** the full A→C handoff works end-to-end — **Adry found
  the gap → filed a `type:feature-gap` issue → Fini completed it** with tested
  code. This is the architecture-evolution loop the suite was designed for.

### Lessons for next run
- Host run (`--sandbox none`) needs BOTH `go` and `claude` on PATH: launch
  under `devbox run` (go) with `~/.local/bin` appended (claude). The sandbox
  path is cleaner *if* `~/.codex` (forfait) is mounted into the container —
  it currently is not, so host-mode is the reliable forfait path until that's
  wired (or an API key is used).
- The implementation lands on a storage branch (`--merge-into none`) for human
  review — the operator merges it (or routes it through adr-rechallenge) rather
  than Fini pushing to main. Correct default for an autonomous code-mutating bot.
- Convergence was clean (0 fixers) because the gap_spec was precise (Adry's
  issue carried evidence + acceptance criteria). A vague gap_spec would lean
  harder on the review-fix loop.
