# Seki + deepsec — validation

## 2026-06-22 — scans OK (deepsec 37; 2 CRIT/2 HIGH); triage stalled on gpt-5.5 (run 019ef04e-35f3)

- Status: **partial** — scanners ran and produced findings; the `triage` node **stalled** on sandboxed gpt-5.5 (cancelled after ~18 min / engine stall-alert) so auto-triage + board-emit did not complete.
- Versions: bot sec-audit-source · iterion v0.16.0 (110ea1c33) · `iterion-sandbox-sec:edge`
- Method: launched via studio API (`POST /api/runs`) for the HTTP board transport. `remediate=false`. claw gpt-5.5 forfait triage + glm-5.2 voters (z.ai). deepsec enabled.
- Result (scans on disk under `.iterion/security/scan/`): **deepsec finding_count 37** (raw severities: 2 CRITICAL, 2 HIGH, 2 HIGH_BUG, 6 BUG, 58 MEDIUM); gosec/semgrep-go/js/py/bandit ran (0 lang findings); gitleaks 730 (≈all noise from gitignored local `.env*` backups holding live keys, incl. the campaign's own `.env.dogfood-bak`). Top criticals to triage: RCE via unvalidated RepoURL→`git clone` (pkg/runner/loop.go:812), SSRF via RepoURL (pkg/runner/loop.go:689), non-unique shard run IDs (cmd/iterion/scan_shards.go:327) — **verification vs current guards (runner git-RCE guard / `ValidateCloneSource` / c9e18195) in progress; several may be already-mitigated.**
- Findings: (1) **`triage` stalls on sandboxed gpt-5.5 with the large detect_tech+all-scans input** — same gpt-5.5-forfait large-context root cause as Evoly's `aggregate_review`. Run triage on a 200K-context model (glm-5.2/opus) or cap its input. (2) trivy + semgrep-auto reported as errored in the triage summary even though semgrep-auto.json was produced — re-check the sec-image scanner invocations. (3) gitleaks scans gitignored `.env*` backups → 730 FP secret hits; the bot's FP suppression should exclude gitignored dotfiles.
- Lessons: re-run Seki's triage→revalidate→emit on **glm-5.2 (z.ai, 200K ctx)** after the z.ai reset to complete the audit; the raw `deepsec.json` is preserved so scans need not re-run.

## 2026-06-14 — C082 board-emit RESOLVED + validated end-to-end (run 019ec4fe)

- Status: **FIXED.** The board-emit gap that made Seki's `report_card` confabulate
  `board.create` ids now works: a sandboxed `claude_code` board-cap node reaches the
  per-run board MCP listener and its `create_issue` lands on the operator board.
- Versions: iterion branch `c082-board-emit` (closer `21e9a66b`, on top of the
  8-commit C082 stack `ee406ac6`→`816dcd0f`) · validated with a minimal
  `claude_code` `create_issue` bot, not Seki itself (faster signal, same code path).
- Method: dedicated worktree studio (fresh static binary, isolated store
  `/tmp/c082val`, `iterion-sandbox-sec:edge`); `merge_into=none`.
- Result: board total **0 → 1**, issue fetchable by real native id
  (`native:1714f23b…`, state `inbox`), `mcp__iterion_board__create_issue` invoked,
  run **finished**.
- Engine hardening — the closer after the 8-commit producer stack:
  1. **`serverInfo.version` (THE fix, `21e9a66b`)** — claude-code's MCP client
     connected over plain HTTP but Zod-**rejected** the `initialize` response because
     `serverInfo.version` was missing ("expected string, received undefined") → the
     whole connection was dropped → tools never surfaced → confabulation. Handler now
     returns `serverInfo.version "1.0.0"`. This disproves the earlier
     https-only / tool-search-deferral / session-id hypotheses (captured the actual
     ZodError via claude-code's own MCP debug against the live listener).
  2. **`alwaysLoad:true` on the board MCP server** — exempts it from claude-code's
     tool-search deferral so `mcp__iterion_board__*` surface without a ToolSearch hit.
- Lessons for next run: (a) the diagnostic `--debug` passthrough does **not** ship —
  claude-code eats the `--debug` value as a positional prompt arg, conflicting with
  `--input-format stream-json` (CLI exit 1); use `--debug=mcp` +
  `CLAUDE_CODE_DEBUG_LOGS_DIR` to re-capture. (b) Re-run Seki itself sandboxed to
  confirm `report_card` now posts real (not confabulated) ids to the board.

## 2026-06-14 — real-bot Seki re-run for C082: 2 forfait-robustness bugs (runs 019ec55a, 019ec579)

- Status: **partial.** Goal was to confirm `report_card` posts REAL board ids on
  the actual bot (not just the minimal validation bot above). BOTH attempts
  **failed before `report_card`**, on two DISTINCT bugs — neither is C082 (C082
  board-emit is proven by the minimal bot; the per-run board MCP listener started
  fine on both: `host.docker.internal:42053`/`:37717`). Root cause of both: the
  flaky `claw/openai/gpt-5.5` (forfait) agents return `json`-typed fields in
  **variable shapes** across runs, and several deterministic consumers don't
  normalize them. Method: worktree binary (C082) + isolated studio :4899 +
  `iterion-sandbox-sec:edge` scanning a clean iterion clone, `enable_deepsec=false`,
  `remediate=false`.
- **Bug A — `filter_cached_files` crash → FIXED (`d6ad8f3c`).** `triage` emitted
  `candidates` as a dict keyed by candidate-id (`{CAND-001:{...}}`) instead of a
  list; `for c in candidates: c.get(...)` iterated the dict KEYS (strings) →
  `AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'get'` (exit 1). This is the
  newer incremental-cache node, never run end-to-end before (the 2026-06-13 run
  had no such node), so it shipped unguarded while `majority_verdict` was already
  defensive. Fix: normalize dict→list at the funnel that feeds `fresh_candidates`.
- **Bug B — `run_lang_scanners` exit 127 → ROOT-CAUSED, not fixed (engine).**
  `detect_tech` returned `langs` as a **list of plain strings** in run #2
  (`["Go","TypeScript",...]`) vs a **dict** in run #1. iterion's
  `shellEscapeValue` renders a `[]interface{}` of strings **space-separated**, so
  `LANGS={{input.langs}}` became `LANGS=Go TypeScript JavaScript …` → the shell
  set `LANGS=Go` and ran `TypeScript` as a command → `bash: line 1: TypeScript:
  command not found` (exit 127). The dict shape JSON-marshals to ONE shell-escaped
  token, which is why run #1 got past it. The node's own `_norm_langs` handles
  both shapes — but the value never survives the shell. **Recommended fix
  (tracked, NOT done — blast radius):** make `shellEscapeValue` render a
  `[]interface{}` of strings as compact JSON (a single shell-escaped token, like
  it already does for maps and complex slices), reserving space-join for typed
  `[string]` fields (which arrive as `[]string`, not `[]interface{}`). 8 catalog
  bots use `VAR={{...}}` patterns, so this needs a blast-radius audit + test
  before shipping ([pkg/backend/model/executor_tool.go](../../pkg/backend/model/executor_tool.go) `shellEscapeValue`).
- Systemic lesson: gpt-5.5/forfait `json` fields are shape-unstable (dict↔list)
  run-to-run; every deterministic consumer (python tool node) of an agent `json`
  array-field must normalize, OR the engine must render `json` fields canonically.
  `majority_verdict` is the model (it normalizes both shapes + guards
  `isinstance`). Until the engine fix lands, Seki's SAST read-pipeline is not
  reliably end-to-end on forfait; running its agent nodes on `claude_code`/opus
  (`ITERION_SEC_AUDIT_BACKEND=claude_code`) would sidestep the shape flakiness for
  a clean validation.

## 2026-06-13 (retest, FIXED) — scanner invocations repaired → full pipeline (run 019ec230)

- Status: **scan_health now PASSES; Seki runs the full read pipeline end-to-end**
  (detect_tech → scanners → scan_health → cap_findings → triage → N-vote → report_card).
  The 019ec1e0 hard-fail below was NOT a broken sec image — it was four broken scanner
  *invocations* in the bot/skills (the binaries all work). Fixed in `a8fac4c5`; **no
  Dockerfile change needed.**
- The fixes (see commit): **semgrep** `--config=auto --metrics=off` → `--config=p/default`
  (auto-config is rejected with metrics off — the silent error that left only 1/3 generic
  scanners; this is THE unblock — semgrep-auto.json now lands → 2/3 floor → scan_health
  passes degraded). **gosec** was scanning `.iterion/worktrees/` (dozens of repo copies) →
  11 min/no-output; `-exclude-dir=.iterion -exclude-dir=.works` → **125 s + 168 KB output**
  (validated standalone). **trivy** choked traversing `.iterion`/`.works` → `--scanners`
  (modern flag, was deprecated `--security-checks`) + `--skip-dirs=.iterion,.works,vendor`.
- **Validated end-to-end**: 019ec230 reached scan_health (degraded, 2/3 generic) → triage →
  N-vote (voter_v1/v2/v3) → report_card. (One earlier attempt was drained mid-N-vote by a
  *parallel session*'s `.go` edit restarting `task studio:dev` — an environment artifact,
  not a Seki bug; resumed from the `voter_v1` checkpoint to finish.)
- **Value proven**: even deepsec-OFF, Seki surfaced a **real CRITICAL candidate** —
  *"RCE in cloud runner via unvalidated RepoURL passed to git clone (pkg/runner/loop.go)"*
  (the file does clone `msg.RepoURL` at L689 → `prepareRepoWorkspace` L789). Status
  `uncertain` (N-vote didn't fully confirm) — worth operator triage.
### C082 root cause + fix design (board-emit, the remaining gap)

Traced precisely (2026-06-13): the sandboxed board MCP HTTP transport is **declared on
both ends but the PRODUCER side is never wired**, so sandboxed claude_code/claw board
caps silently no-op and the agent **confabulates** the board.create IDs:
- **Server side exists**: `BoardMCPTokenRegistry` + `RegisterBoardMCPRoutes(/api/v1/mcp/board,
  store, reg)` ([pkg/server/mcp_board_handler.go](pkg/server/mcp_board_handler.go),
  server.go:870) — BUT `boardMCPTokens.Register(token, caps)` is **never called** for a run.
- **Consumer side exists**: `Task.BoardHTTPEndpoint`/`BoardRunToken` + claude_code.go:477
  consume them (and :490 warns + disables board MCP when empty) — BUT **nothing in the
  runtime/executor ever SETS them** (grep: zero assignments). So they're always "" →
  board MCP disabled under sandbox → confabulation.
- **Fix design**: (1) plumb a `register(caps)→token` closure + a board endpoint URL from
  the server into `model.ExecutorSpec`→`ClawExecutor`; (2) in the Task builder
  ([executor.go ~1245](pkg/backend/model/executor.go)) for sandboxed board-cap nodes:
  `task.BoardRunToken = register(caps); task.BoardHTTPEndpoint = url`. (3) **CRITICAL
  networking caveat** — the endpoint must be *container-reachable*: `iterion studio` binds
  `127.0.0.1` (loopback, NOT reachable via `host.docker.internal`); the egress proxy only
  works because the docker driver's `ProxyConfigurer` binds a gateway-reachable interface.
  The board endpoint needs the same (bind gateway/0.0.0.0, or tunnel via the proxy). This
  networking requirement = it MUST be live-validated against a container (a sandboxed run
  confirming the write lands), so it should be implemented when the studio is free (no
  parallel session to drain on the rebuild) or against a dedicated `iterion server` bound
  on a gateway-reachable port. Not shipped blind.

- **board-emit (C082) STILL DOESN'T LAND (bilan #4 persists — a distinct engine gap).**
  report_card DID invoke `board.create`×3 / `board.label`×3 / `board.move`×2 and its
  `created_issues` output carries real native-looking IDs (`native:90543c66…`), but the
  issues are **NOT on the operator's board** (total unchanged at 94; fetch-by-id + every
  label query miss). The sandboxed board MCP HTTP transport (`/api/v1/mcp/board` +
  ephemeral run token) returns success but the writes don't persist to the operator's
  native board — even when launched via the studio. Seki's findings are recoverable from
  the run (`iterion report --run-id 019ec230`), not the board. This is the one remaining
  Seki gap; it is **separate from the scanner fixes** (which are done) and needs a focused
  look at the sandboxed board HTTP transport.
- **Residual (tracked, non-blocking)**: gosec + trivy still emit nothing *inside the
  sandbox specifically* (both work standalone) — a deeper sandbox/proxy/go-module
  interaction. scan_health passes on gitleaks + semgrep (2/3) regardless; semgrep
  (go/js/py/default) + bandit carry the SAST coverage; deepsec ON remains the
  highest-value path (019ec142).

## 2026-06-13 (retest) — engine fixes + safe default, via STUDIO (run 019ec1e0)

- Status: **engine fixes validated via the studio path; safe default shipped; but
  the run HARD-FAILED at `scan_health` — correctly — because the sec image's generic
  scanner toolchain is broken.** detect_tech (which FAILED in 019ec10f/019ec13a) now
  completes; the read chain ran to the coverage gate, which then refused to certify a
  thin audit. Board-emit NOT reached (failed before `report_card`).
- Versions: bot sec-audit-source 0.1.0 · iterion 778b9860 / bbdca0da / ea61817a /
  92c40d62
- Method: launched via **studio** `POST /api/runs` (so the HTTP board transport is
  wired — C082), `remediate=false` (now the default), `enable_deepsec=false` (lean:
  validate generic+lang scanners → triage → report → board-emit cheaply; deepsec's
  vuln-finding was already proven in 019ec142). Sandbox `iterion-sandbox-sec:edge`.

### Validated by the engine fixes (the headline)
- **detect_tech now completes** (claw + sandbox). In 019ec10f/019ec13a it died at
  this first claw node; the TLS-inspect-proxy hang (FIXED 778b9860) was the cause.
  The whole read chain ran: inventory → detect_tech → context → diff_scope →
  plan_shards → run_generic_scanners → run_lang_scanners → … Confirms the proxy +
  empty-tool-result fixes hold for the **operator's actual (studio) path**, not just
  CLI.
- **remediate=false (92c40d62)** — `iterion validate` clean; the run is read-only by
  default (no live-tree edits, no branch hijack). Safe under `task studio:dev`.
- **{{run.id}} (ea61817a)** — opt-in remediation will now name its branch
  `iterion/sec-fix/<real-run-id>` instead of the literal `iterion/sec-fix/run.id`.

### scan_health hard-failed — CORRECTLY (the headline blocker)
The run reached `scan_health` and **hard-failed (run_failed, exit 1)** with:
`{"generic_expected":3,"generic_present":1,"min_generic":2,"missing":[trivy.json,
semgrep-auto.json (generic), gosec.json (lang)],"total_findings_seen":1596,
"healthy":false,"degraded":true}` — *"only 1 of 3 always-on generic scanners produced
output (need ≥2)"*. This is the **anti-façade gate working as designed**: it refuses to
certify an audit when the core generic toolchain is down, even though lang/custom
scanners saw 1596 raw findings. (019ec142 passed because ≥2 generic scanners happened
to run that time — the toolchain is flaky.)

### THE BLOCKER: the sec image's scanner toolchain is broken (infra, not engine/bot)
Scanners are installed (`trivy 0.70.0`, `gosec`, `gitleaks 8.21.2`, `govulncheck`,
`semgrep` on PATH) but **fail at runtime** in `iterion-sandbox-sec:edge`:
1. **trivy** → `FATAL ... unable to create temporary directory: stat /tmp/trivy-10:
   no such file or directory`. A /tmp/TMPDIR issue in the image (reproduced with a bare
   `docker run … trivy fs`). Also the bot still passes the **deprecated** `--security-checks`
   flag (renamed `--scanners` in modern trivy) — fix both.
2. **semgrep** → `semgrep --version` prints nothing; `--config=auto` needs to fetch its
   rule pack from the registry (network) and produced no output. Broken install and/or
   registry fetch.
3. **gosec** → ran **>11 min** then produced **no `gosec.json`** (timed out / errored
   after type-checking the full import graph — `-exclude-dir=vendor` filters reporting,
   not loading). Needs a timeout + scoping.
→ **Both sec bots (Seki + Depsy) are gated on this.** The fix is a focused
`sandbox/sec/Dockerfile` + scanner-invocation pass (TMPDIR for trivy, `--scanners`,
fix/repin semgrep, bound gosec), then republish via CI `build-sandbox-sec`. Not done
here — it's image infra, out of scope for the bot retest; tracked as the sec-bot blocker.

### Lessons for next run
- Launch sec bots **via the studio** (board transport wired) — a bare CLI run no-ops
  board writes (C082). detect_tech + the claw path now work end-to-end (engine fixes).
- **Don't trust sec-bot output until the sec image's trivy/semgrep/gosec are fixed** —
  `scan_health` will (rightly) hard-fail or banner on the broken toolchain. deepsec ON
  is the only currently-working value path (019ec142), and even it runs degraded.

## 2026-06-13 — iterion self-audit dogfood (runs 019ec10f, 019ec13a, **019ec142**)

> **Update — run 019ec142 (after both engine fixes + static-binary re-copy):

>   `worktree: auto`.** So by default Seki *edits code* (it is **not** read-only,
>   contra the doc "does not fix unless remediate enabled"), and the edits hit the

- Status: **read pipeline VALIDATED (019ec142); remediation phase unsafe
  (self-kill + studio brick). Original blockers ↓ fixed.**
- Versions: bot sec-audit-source 0.1.0 · iterion 7fea84cd→f247f360
- Method: `POST /api/runs`, `severity_threshold=high`, sandboxed
  (`iterion-sandbox-sec:edge`, present). Goal: re-find the known HIGH
  `source:sec-audit-self` issues (SSRF `runs_preview.go`, path-traversal
  `runs_files.go`) and validate `scan_health` + `cap_findings`.
- Result: **never reached the scanners** — failed at `detect_tech` (first `claw`
  node) both runs. But each failure root-caused a real sandbox/claw bug:
  1. **`backendIsClaw` missed env-templated backends (FIXED `f247f360`).** Seki's
     nodes use `backend: "${ITERION_SEC_AUDIT_BACKEND:-claw}"`; the IR stores it
     verbatim, so `containsClawNode` read it as non-claw at spec-build time and
     `addClawBinaryMount` never bind-mounted the host iterion → the in-container
     `iterion __claw-runner` died with `exec: "iterion": executable file not
     found in $PATH`. Fix: expand the template in `backendIsClaw` like the
     executor does (`ir.ExpandEnvWithDefault`). Regression test added. **This also
     unblocks Depsy (`sec-audit-deps`)**, which uses the same pattern.
  2. **The host iterion bind-mounted into the container must be STATIC.** Once #1
     mounted it, the next failure was `exec: /usr/local/bin/iterion: no such file
     or directory` — the mounted binary was a devbox `go build` (default
     `CGO_ENABLED=1`) **dynamically linked against nix glibc**, whose loader isn't
     in the container. Fix is operational: install a static build
     (`CGO_ENABLED=0` / `task build`); CLAUDE.md's live-dogfood note now spells
     this out. (Candidate engine hardening: `iterion sandbox doctor` / the mount
     path could detect a dynamic host binary and fail with a clear message
     instead of a retry-then-cryptic-ENOENT; or the sec/full images could bake a
     static iterion on PATH.)
- Lessons for next run: after the operator re-copies the **static** binary to
  `/usr/bin/iterion`, re-launch; `detect_tech` should clear and the run proceed to
  the scanners + `scan_health` gate. Then validate it re-finds the known HIGH
  findings. The SAST capability itself is unproven on iterion *yet* — only the
  sandbox plumbing was exercised.

---

**Status:** validated end-to-end (2026-06). **Scope of this report:** the
capability and the engineering hardening only — it carries **no information
about the audited codebase** (a third-party repository; all target details are
deliberately omitted or generalized).

## Summary

Seki (the `sec-audit-source` bot) with the integrated **deepsec** scanner and
the in-run **remediation** phase was exercised against a real-world repository.
It demonstrably:

1. **finds subtle, high-value vulnerabilities that signature-based scanners
   miss** (deepsec's LLM analysis vs the regex/AST scanners);
2. **authors complete, root-cause, test-backed fixes** — including a hard
   design-level one it had earlier had the discipline to *decline*;
3. **drives the full pipeline** detect → context → scan → triage →
   adversarial N-vote → verified-remediation ladder → **human approval gate**.

The exercise also hardened the pipeline: **six runtime bugs were found and
fixed** while driving real runs.

## What was validated

- The integrated pipeline: `detect_tech → project_context → scanners
  (generic + language + deepsec) → triage/dedup → N-voter "disprove"
  revalidation → report_card → remediation ladder (patch → build → reproduce →
  regress → re-attack → isolated review → aggregate) → human gate`.
- **deepsec** as an LLM scanner alongside the deterministic scanners, on the
  local Claude Code subscription backend (no API key).
- **apply-gated** remediation: edits applied in a worktree, paused at a human
  gate before anything merges.

## Method

A single end-to-end run against a large real-world repository — a compiled
backend plus a JS/TS frontend, thousands of tracked files, with
authentication, cryptography, and a database. Backend = local Claude Code
subscription. *(No further target detail is recorded here by design.)*

## Results

### deepsec finds what signature scanners miss

deepsec surfaced around a dozen findings, including logic/auth issues invisible
to the deterministic scanners (which contributed container/config and
standard-rule matches). Representative **classes** (generalized):

- an **authentication-relay CSRF** (account-takeover class): a sensitive login
  step completed with no binding to the browser that initiated it, so a
  relayed out-of-band confirmation could authenticate a session it never
  started;
- a **key-management fail-open**: a development key path reachable outside
  production;
- a **session-cookie integrity gap**;
- **container / supply-chain hardening**: runtime running as root, mutable
  base-image tags (no digest pinning);
- a **nil-dereference DoS** in an unrecovered worker goroutine.

The signature scanners found none of the first three.

### Seki authors complete, root-cause, tested fixes — including the hard one

The headline result is on the **authentication-relay CSRF** — a design-level
fix spanning several files. In an earlier run Seki **correctly declined** to
patch it with a minimal one-file diff, explicitly refusing to ship a
backend-only change that would build and test green while leaving the flaw
exploitable ("security-theatre the ladder cannot detect") and routing it to
human review.

Once the pipeline could carry it (see hardening below), Seki's remediation
authored the **full root-cause fix**:

- a **server-derived, origin-bound confirmation token** (an HMAC over the
  challenge identifier and the browser-binding nonce) that gates the sensitive
  completion step — so a relayed confirmation can no longer authenticate a
  session it did not initiate;
- a **failing-then-passing regression test**.

A genuine multi-file, cross-stack security fix *with a test* — not a line-level
patch. This is the core demonstration: the tool finds a hard, subtle flaw and
remediates it at the root, or defers it cleanly when it cannot do so properly.

### Pipeline discipline (precision + safety)

- **Adversarial N-vote**: the "disprove" revalidation rejected the large
  majority of raw scanner candidates; only a minority were confirmed. High
  precision against scanner noise.
- **Hard-stops**: crypto/secrets findings are never auto-patched — routed to
  human review by design.
- **Reviewer isolation**: the final reviewer judge sees only a four-field
  projection `{file, line, category, diff}` — never the scanner prose or
  exploit narrative — a deliberate prompt-injection barrier.
- **Human gate**: the run pauses before any merge; nothing lands unattended.

## Engineering hardening (bugs found + fixed)

Driving real runs surfaced and fixed six runtime issues (all merged to `main`):

| Area | Issue | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Remediation loop | the per-run "attempted" ledger, relayed through a `compute` and rendered as Go `%v`, was rejected by the JSON parser → the loop re-picked the same finding forever | parse the ledger leniently; then carry it as a **comma-separated string** (a multi-element `%v` with spaces also broke the tool's shell, exit 127) — shell-safe and parse-safe |
| deepsec resilience | the deepsec step lost its **entire** contribution on a transient blip, and **hung indefinitely** on a mid-run network loss (its SDK does not self-recover) | retry the process once + bound it with a **timeout** so a hang is killed and auto-retried |
| Budget | a hardcoded duration/iteration budget capped audit+remediation on a large repo | env-configurable, raised defaults |
| Project toolchain | build/test rungs run in the **project's own pinned toolchain** (devbox); the persistent Nix store is default-on so they run warm | sandbox driver + bot rungs |
| Skill resolution | remediation prompts pointed at a skill path not reliably present in the worktree | point at the always-mounted run bundle |

## Known remaining work (verdict quality)

Reaching the gate surfaced a remaining tail that currently keeps confirmed
findings at **`uncertain`** (proposed) rather than **`verified`**
(auto-committed). None of these block the pipeline — it reaches the human gate
— but they gate the verified-auto-apply outcome:

- the reviewer-isolation **projection compute** does not substitute its inputs
  (nested output access in a `compute` expr), so the reviewer receives
  placeholders and fail-closes;
- the **reproduce** rung occasionally still fires after a valid fix
  (calibration);
- the gate **summary under-counts** the proposed artifacts.

Scoped as the next focused task — verdict-quality polish, not capability.

## Conclusion

Seki + deepsec is validated: it finds relevant, subtle vulnerabilities that
signature scanners miss, and it authors complete, tested, root-cause fixes —
including a design-level fix it deferred until it could do it properly — while
running the whole pipeline to a human approval gate with adversarial
revalidation, hard-stops, and reviewer isolation. The open items are
verdict-quality polish.
