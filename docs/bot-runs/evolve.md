# Evoly (`evolve`) — bot run bilan

Strategic / architectural evolution partner. Surveys a mature repo,
accumulates a long-horizon vision in **per-bot** memory across sessions,
elicits operator context, and proposes evolutions as dispatch-ready
backlog tickets + findings for Nexie. See
[bots/evolve/README.md](../../bots/evolve/README.md). Append newest-first.

## 2026-06-13 — mid-turn ask_user restored + validated (run 019ec2f6)

- **Status:** validated. After the engine fix (commit e93ccc1b — see
  finding #1), `investigate` reverted from the `ask_brief` human-node
  workaround back to the **original design: mid-turn `ask_user`** on the
  agent (`interaction: human`). Live on claw + openai/gpt-5.5 forfait:
  survey → investigate **asks the operator via ask_user** ("what objective
  + horizon?") → pauses cleanly → resume injects the answer → investigate
  **persists to memory + asks a follow-up ask_user** ("which backend
  combos must be conformance-tested?") → pauses again. Genuinely iterative
  mid-investigation elicitation, multiple ask_user round-trips on a
  schema+tools node, zero 400s. The `ask_brief` node + its schemas were
  removed; the graph is back to 17 nodes.
- **Misc:** the agent persisted the first answer to `vision_interrogation.md`
  rather than the prompt's `CONTEXT_BRIEF.md` — it persists correctly, just
  off the named file; tighten the prompt if strict filename adherence
  matters (non-blocking — the auto-index surfaces it either way).

## 2026-06-13 — first dogfood: per-bot memory + full pipeline (runs 019ec1d5, 019ec1dc)

- **Status:** validated — the **full** pipeline ran live end-to-end:
  survey → ask_brief → investigate → synthesize → cross-family review →
  human_review (approved) → **propose_evolutions (9 findings) →
  emit_backlog (9 dispatch-ready backlog tickets) → home base**.
- **Versions:** bot 0.1.0 · iterion worktree `worktree-evolve-bot` (base
  `d1fe421c`).
- **Method:** all memory-bearing nodes `claw` + `openai/gpt-5.5` (ChatGPT
  forfait); the one cross-family "claude" reviewer `claude_code` +
  `claude-opus-4-8` (Claude Code OAuth forfait). Run from the
  `.claude/worktrees/evolve-bot` worktree against the iterion repo itself.
  `--var scope_notes=...`. No `--store-dir` (workspace default). No
  worktree:/sandbox: (read-only bot).
- **Result:** converged to the `human_review_vision` pause across two
  sessions. Run 2 (019ec1d5): survey → ask_brief (paused, answered via
  resume) → investigate (wrote CONTEXT_BRIEF.md) → synthesize (wrote
  VISION.md) → **failed at review_fanout** (workspace-safety: reviewers
  missing `readonly`). Run 3/4 (019ec1dc, after the readonly fix): full
  pipeline through both reviewers → aggregate (wait_all) → carry →
  human_review pause. review_claude on claude_code: 48s, 7979 tok, $0.34.
  Per-node gpt-5.5 nodes ~$0.05–0.09 each.
- **Propose + emit (resumed 019ec1dc with approval):** `propose_evolutions`
  wrote **9 deep finding artifacts** to `findings/` (decompose-ClawExecutor,
  capability-context-policy, bot-contract-v1, run-lifecycle-transition-policy,
  observability-event-taxonomy, persisted-format-stable-subset,
  dogfood-data-contracts, dispatcher-claims-leases, cloud-local-alignment) —
  each with proper frontmatter (`kind:evolution` / `source_bot:evolve` /
  axis+horizon+severity tags) and a grounded Why/Plan/Acceptance body.
  `emit_backlog` then created **9 `backlog` kanban tickets** on the main-repo
  board, **`bot: feature-dev` set via `set_bot` on 8** (the 9th left bot-less,
  no confident match), labelled `<axis>` + `horizon:<now|next|later>`. So a
  human can drag any ticket to `ready` to launch it, or Nexie can ingest them
  — exactly the requested handoff. ~$0.09 propose + $0.09 emit.
- **Value:** genuinely useful strategic output — a 10-axis vision *"Iterion
  as a Trustworthy Local Team Engine"* (backend-pipeline decomposition,
  one RunLifecycle contract, an auditable CapabilityContext, dispatcher
  invariants, observability taxonomy, .bot/persisted-format v1 subsets…),
  each axis with direction / key_moves / target_state, plus 11 guardrails
  and a rationale. Grounded in real files (ClawExecutor overload,
  Engine option sprawl, checkpoint-vs-event authority). This is exactly the
  "architect a vision" deliverable.

### Headline feature PROVEN live: per-bot cross-session memory

- `visibility: bot` writes landed at
  `~/.iterion/projects/-home-jo-lab-ai-iterion/bots/evolve/memory/vision/`
  (CONTEXT_BRIEF.md + VISION.md), and the **legacy project path
  `…/memory/vision/` was ABSENT** — proving the bot-visibility axis, not the
  legacy project-shared path.
- **Stable across worktrees:** the run launched from the *worktree*, but the
  memory keyed off the **main repo root** (`-home-jo-lab-ai-iterion`), not
  the ephemeral worktree path — i.e. `memBase = task.RepoRoot` via
  `findGitRoot`. So a future run from the main checkout sees the same
  accumulated vision. (This is the G2 worktree-stability concern from the
  plan, validated live.)
- **Cross-session continuity proven:** run 3's survey autoloaded run 2's
  VISION.md/CONTEXT_BRIEF.md and produced *materially deeper* axes — the
  accumulated context made the second pass smarter, exactly the intent.

### Findings / engine hardening

1. **(ENGINE BUG, HIGH — FIXED) mid-turn `ask_user` failed on schema+tools
   interaction nodes.** The bot's first design used `interaction: human`
   on the investigate agent to ask mid-turn via the `ask_user` MCP tool.
   On claw+openai it failed: instead of pausing, the run hit `openai 400:
   No tool output found` / `tool_call_ids did not have response messages`.
   - **Root cause (iterion, NOT claw-code-go).** Reproduced minimally:
     ask_user pauses fine on a node WITHOUT an output schema, but FAILS on
     one WITH a schema. `ClawExecutor` (executor.go) ran schema validation
     BEFORE the `_needs_interaction` short-circuit. The pause Result
     (`{_needs_interaction:true, …}`) is a control signal, not schema data,
     so `ValidateOutput` failed → triggered the schema-validation backend
     RETRY → the retry replayed the unanswered tool_call into a fresh
     generation → orphaned function_call → 400. (My earlier "claw-code-go
     intercepts ask_user" hypothesis was wrong — instrumented logging
     showed `errors.As` matched and the pause Result was returned correctly;
     a *higher* layer re-invoked.)
   - **Fixed** in `pkg/backend/model/executor.go` (move the interaction
     short-circuit ahead of schema validation) + regression test
     `TestDelegation_InteractionSignalSkipsSchemaValidation`. Verified live:
     a schema+tools+interaction node now pauses on ask_user and resumes to a
     valid structured output. Commit e93ccc1b (on main).
   - **Evoly impact:** the `ask_brief` graph-level human node shipped as a
     workaround and still works; it can now optionally revert to the
     original mid-turn `ask_user` design (set `interaction: human` on
     `investigate` + restore the ask_user prompt).
2. **(BOT BUG, fixed) reviewers needed `readonly: true`.** The two parallel
   judge reviewers had mutation-capable tools (`bash`) without `readonly`,
   so the workspace-safety guard rejected 2 mutating parallel branches.
   Added `readonly: true` to both (they only inspect). Lesson for any
   fan-out of tool-equipped judges: mark them `readonly`.
3. **(BOT BUG, fixed) review prompts referenced a whole-node output.** The
   reviewers' verdicts revealed they received the **literal unsubstituted
   `{{outputs.synthesize_vision}}`** token — so they reviewed nothing (and
   correctly withheld approval). Root cause: in a **prompt body**,
   `{{outputs.<node>}}` (a whole node output) does NOT resolve — only
   `{{outputs.<node>.<field>}}` does — whereas edge `with` mappings DO
   resolve whole-output refs (that's why human_review got the full vision via
   `carry_vision.vision`). Fixed: the review prompts now reference the
   edge-mapped `{{input.vision}}`. *Underlying engine asymmetry worth noting:*
   whole-output `{{outputs.<node>}}` resolves in an edge `with` but silently
   no-ops in a prompt body (and structured outputs render as Go `map[...]`,
   not JSON, in prompts/forms).
4. **(BOT BUG, fixed) findings scope keyed off WorkDir, not RepoRoot.**
   `propose_evolutions` wrote its 9 findings to
   `projects/<WORKTREE-key>/memory/findings/`, while the board tickets and
   Nexie's inbox live at the stable `<REPO-ROOT-key>`. The per-bot **vision**
   scope (`visibility: bot`) correctly re-roots to `RepoRoot`; the **findings**
   scope used the bare legacy form (→ `WorkDir`), which diverges under a git
   worktree. In normal (non-worktree) use they coincide, but fixed by adding
   `visibility: "project"` to the findings block (re-roots to `RepoRoot`,
   matching the board + Nexie). Validated by analogy to the vision scope,
   whose `RepoRoot` keying is proven live.
5. **(NIT) `iterion validate` is more lenient than `iterion run`.** A literal
   `{{issue.title}}` mention in a prompt body (documentation text) passed
   `validate` but failed `run` with `C004 unknown reference namespace`.
   Validate should catch C004 too. (Fixed in the bot by de-bracing.)

> Dogfood side-effect: this validation created 9 real `backlog` tickets on the
> local main-repo board (gitignored `.iterion/dispatcher/`). They are genuine,
> useful iterion-evolution proposals, but their finding-file links point at the
> (ephemeral) worktree key — dispatch or delete them, then re-run Evoly from the
> main checkout for cleanly-keyed output.

### Lessons for next run

- The mid-turn ask_user limitation is real for forfait users — until the
  claw+openai fix lands, **author operator interaction as graph-level
  `human` nodes**, not mid-turn `ask_user`, on any claw+openai bot.
- Full cycle (incl. propose + emit) now proven. Next: confirm on `/board`
  that a drag-to-`ready` actually dispatches `feature-dev` from a ticket whose
  body is the spec (the dispatch_vars title+body path), and that the
  visibility:project findings now co-locate with the board on a real run.
- The reviewers should reference `{{input.X}}`, never `{{outputs.<node>}}`
  (whole-output) in prompt bodies. Consider an engine fix so whole-output
  refs resolve (and render as JSON) in prompts, matching edge `with`.
- Add `source:evolve` to emit's label set explicitly (this run labelled by
  axis + horizon but the `source:evolve` label didn't appear — verify the
  set_labels call includes it).
- The vision quality on gpt-5.5 was high; opus (via `claude_code`, or claw
  if an API key is ever acceptable) would only be worth it for the synthesis
  node if the operator wants more depth.
