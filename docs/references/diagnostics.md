# Iterion DSL — Validation Diagnostics

All diagnostic codes emitted during compilation (`ir.Compile`) and validation (`ir.Validate`). Diagnostics are either **errors** (block execution) or **warnings** (informational).

## Compilation Diagnostics

| Code | Severity | Description | Cause | Fix |
|------|----------|-------------|-------|-----|
| **C001** | error | Unknown node reference | An edge references a node that is not declared | Declare the node or fix the name typo |
| **C002** | error | Unknown schema reference | A node's `input:` or `output:` references an undeclared schema | Declare the schema or fix the name |
| **C003** | error | Unknown prompt reference | A node's `system:` or `user:` references an undeclared prompt | Declare the prompt or fix the name |
| **C004** | error | Bad template reference | A `{{...}}` template expression is malformed | Use `{{vars.X}}`, `{{input.X}}`, `{{outputs.node.field}}`, `{{artifacts.X}}`, `{{attachments.X}}`, `{{loop.name.iteration}}`, or `{{run.id}}` |
| **C005** | error | Duplicate loop definition | Multiple edges share a loop name but disagree on `max_iterations` | Use the same `max_iterations` value or use different loop names |
| **C006** | error | No workflow found | The file has no `workflow` declaration | Add a `workflow name:` block |
| **C007** | error | Multiple workflows | More than one `workflow` block found | V1 supports one workflow per file — remove extras |
| **C008** | error | Missing entry node | The `entry:` node name doesn't match any declared node | Fix the entry name or declare the node |
| **C018** | error/warning | Missing model/backend or LLM interaction requirements | Agents/judges without `model:` or `backend:` are errors only when no default supervisor model and no auto-detectable runtime credentials are available. `mode: llm` routers without either value produce a warning and use the built-in runtime default. Human nodes using `interaction: llm` or `interaction: llm_or_human` must set `model:` or `interaction_model:` and must declare `output:`. | Add `model: "..."`, `backend: "..."`, or configure detectable credentials/defaults for agents/judges; set explicit model/backend for LLM routers when you do not want runtime defaulting; for LLM-backed human nodes add the interaction model and output schema. |
| **C024** | error | Duplicate MCP server | A `mcp_server` name is declared more than once | Use unique names for each MCP server |
| **C025** | error | Invalid MCP server config | MCP server misconfigured (e.g., stdio without command, http/sse without url) | Match properties to transport type: stdio needs `command`; http and sse need `url` and must not set `command` or `args` |
| **C030** | warning | Codex backend discouraged | A node uses `backend: "codex"` | Codex is still supported but has limitations (cannot configure tool set, fills its own context window, weaker integration). Prefer `backend: "claude_code"` for tool-using agents or `claw` (default) with an OpenAI model (`model: "openai/gpt-5.4-mini"`) for judges/reviewers. |
| **C039** | error | Compute node has no expressions | A `compute` node was declared without any `expr: key: "<expression>"` entries | Add at least one expression mapping an output schema field to an expression — or remove the node |
| **C040** | error | Expression failed to parse | An expression in a `compute` node or in a quoted `when "..."` clause isn't valid | Check operators, parentheses, namespace prefixes (`vars / input / outputs / artifacts / loop / run`), and built-in calls (`length`, `concat`, `unique`, `contains`, `join`, `if`) |
| **C041** | error | Duplicate node id | Two declarations share the same node name across agents/judges/routers/humans/tools/computes | Rename one — node ids are a single global namespace |
| **C042** | error | Reserved node name | A user node is named `done` or `fail` (those are reserved terminal targets) | Pick a different node name |
| **C044** | error | Invalid sandbox mode | A node or workflow's `sandbox:` mode is outside the accepted set (`""`, `none`, `auto`, `inline`); or inline mode is missing an image/build or sets both | Set `sandbox:` to `auto`, `none`, `inline`, or omit it. Block-form sandbox config with `image:`, `build:`, `env:`, `mounts:`, or `network:` compiles as inline mode unless `mode:` is specified; inline requires exactly one of `image:` or `build:`. |
| **C045** | error | Sandbox auto without config | Reserved diagnostic code; not currently emitted by compile/validation. Normal CLI/runtime auto mode supplies a default `iterion-sandbox-slim:<version>` fallback when no `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` is present | No compile-time action. If an embedder disables the default image and runtime reports a missing devcontainer, add `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`, provide a default image, or use inline `sandbox:` with `image:`/`build:` (see [docs/sandbox.md](../sandbox.md)). |
| **C046** | error | Invalid budget cost | `budget.max_cost_usd` is negative, NaN, or infinity | Use a non-negative finite USD amount, or omit the field to disable the cost cap. |

## Validation Diagnostics

| Code | Severity | Description | Cause | Fix |
|------|----------|-------------|-------|-----|
| **C009** | error | Session at convergence point | A node with `await:` (or multiple incoming sources) uses `session: inherit` or `session: fork` | Change to `session: fresh` or `session: artifacts_only` |
| **C010** | error | Multiple unconditional edges | A non-router node has more than one unconditional outgoing edge | Keep only one default edge, or use a router for fan-out |
| **C011** | error | Ambiguous conditions | Same condition field appears twice with same polarity from the same source | Remove the duplicate edge or use different conditions |
| **C012** | error | Missing fallback | A node has conditional edges but no unconditional fallback and conditions aren't exhaustive | Add `when not X` to complement `when X`, or add an unconditional edge |
| **C013** | error | Condition field not boolean | A `when` clause references a field that isn't `bool` in the source output schema | Change the schema field to `bool` |
| **C014** | error | Condition field not found | A `when` clause references a field that doesn't exist in the source output schema | Add the field to the schema or fix the field name |
| **C016** | error | Unreachable node | A declared node cannot be reached from the workflow's `entry:` node | Add edges to reach the node, or remove the unused declaration |
| **C017** | error | History ref not in loop | `{{outputs.node.history}}` is used but the referenced node is not part of any declared loop | Add a loop declaration (`as loop_name(N)`) to the edge cycle, or remove the `.history` reference |
| **C019** | error | Undeclared cycle | A cycle (back-edge) exists without any loop declaration on its edges | Add `as loop_name(N)` to the back-edge to bound the cycle |
| **C020** | error | Round-robin too few edges | A `round_robin` router has fewer than 2 unconditional outgoing edges | Add at least 2 outgoing edges for alternation |
| **C021** | error | LLM router too few edges | An `llm` router has fewer than 2 outgoing edges | Add at least 2 outgoing edges for the LLM to choose from |
| **C022** | error | LLM router edge has condition | An edge from an `llm` router has a `when` clause | Remove the `when` clause — LLM routers select targets directly |
| **C023** | error | LLM-only property on non-LLM router | Properties `model`, `backend`, `system`, `user`, `multi`, or `reasoning_effort` are set on a router that isn't `mode: llm` | Remove these properties or change the mode to `llm` |
| **C026** | error | Invalid loop iterations | A loop's `max_iterations` is less than 1 | Set `max_iterations` to at least 1 |
| **C027** | error | Invalid reasoning effort | `reasoning_effort` has a value other than `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, `max` | Use one of the five valid values |
| **C028** | error | Duplicate with-mapping key | The same `with` key appears on multiple non-conditional edges to the same target | Use unique keys, or make edges conditional/convergent |
| **C029** | error | Unknown outputs node reference | A `{{outputs.<node>...}}` template targets a node not declared anywhere in the file | Declare the node or fix the typo |
| **C031** | error | outputs ref field not in output schema | `{{outputs.<node>.<field>}}` references a field absent from that node's `output:` schema | Reference an existing field, or add the field to the schema |
| **C032** | warning | outputs ref on schemaless node | `{{outputs.<node>.<field>}}` targets a node that has no `output:` schema, so the field cannot be verified | Add an `output:` schema to the source node, or drop the field access |
| **C033** | error | Undeclared variable | `{{vars.X}}` (or `vars.X` inside an expression) targets a variable not declared in the file-level or workflow-level `vars:` block | Declare the variable, or fix the name |
| **C034** | error | input ref field not in input schema | `{{input.<field>}}` references a field absent from the consuming node's `input:` schema | Reference an existing field, or add it to the schema |
| **C035** | error | Unknown artifact | `{{artifacts.X}}` targets an artifact never produced via `publish:` | Add `publish: <name>` on a prior node, or fix the artifact name |
| **C036** | error | Reference to non-reachable node | `{{outputs.<node>...}}` targets a node not reachable from the entry before the consumer | Reorder the graph or wire an edge so the producer runs first |
| **C037** | warning | Node max_tokens exceeds workflow budget | A node-level `max_tokens` is greater than the workflow's `budget.max_tokens` | Lower the node cap, or raise the workflow budget |
| **C038** | error | Unsupported MCP auth type | `mcp_server.auth.type` is something other than `oauth2` (the only wired type) | Drop the `auth:` block, or change `type` to `oauth2` |
| **C043** | error | Invalid compaction values | `compaction.threshold` is outside `(0, 1]` or `compaction.preserve_recent` is `< 1` | Use a fraction like `0.85` for `threshold` and an integer `>= 1` for `preserve_recent`; omit either to inherit the default |
| **C050** | error | Duplicate attachment | An attachment name is declared more than once across file-level and workflow-level `attachments:` blocks | Rename the duplicate, or merge the definitions |
| **C051** | error | Attachment / var name collision | An attachment name collides with a declared `vars:` entry | Rename one of them — attachments and vars share a single template namespace |
| **C052** | error | Invalid attachment MIME | An `accept_mime:` entry is not in `type/subtype` form (e.g. `image/png`, `application/pdf`) | Use `type/subtype` MIME values, optionally with `*` subtype wildcards |
| **C053** | error | Unknown attachment reference | `{{attachments.X}}` references an attachment that is not declared in a file-level or workflow-level `attachments:` block | Declare the attachment, or fix the name |
| **C054** | error | Unknown attachment sub-field | `{{attachments.<name>.<subfield>}}` uses a sub-field the runtime does not expose | Drop the sub-field or pick a supported one (`path`, `url`, `mime`, `size`, `sha256`) |
| **C060** | error | Playwright MCP server requires browser-capable sandbox image | An MCP server with the Playwright transport is configured but the workflow's sandbox image is not browser-capable | Use `ghcr.io/socialgouv/iterion-sandbox-browser` (or another browser-capable image whose name matches the validator predicate, such as one containing `sandbox-browser` or `sandbox-full-browser`), or remove the Playwright MCP server |
| **C070** | error | Preset references unknown variable | A `presets:` entry sets a key that does not match any name in `vars:` | Add the variable to `vars:`, or remove/rename the preset key |
| **C071** | error | Preset value type mismatch | A `presets:` value's type (string/int/bool/list) does not match the declared `vars:` type | Cast the value to the declared type, or change the var's type |
| **C072** | error | Duplicate preset name | The same preset name appears more than once in the `presets:` block | Rename or merge the duplicate preset |
| **C080** | warning | Unknown capability | A `capabilities:` entry isn't in the built-in registry (currently: `board.read`, `board.create`, `board.move`, `board.assign`, `board.label`, `board.close`) | Either fix the typo or accept the warning — unknown caps still propagate to the executor (the registry is open for extension) |
| **C081** | error | Malformed capability | A `capabilities:` entry doesn't match the shape `domain` or `domain.action` (lowercase letters/digits/underscores) | Use the lowercase `domain.action` form, e.g. `board.create` |
| **C082** | warning | Board capability inside sandbox | A node grants a `board.*` capability while running under a sandbox — the stdio `__mcp-board` transport is unavailable, the runtime falls back to the HTTP transport on the iterion server | No action required if the iterion HTTP server is reachable from the sandbox; otherwise drop the capability or disable the sandbox for that node |

> **Historical code-reuse note:** earlier releases reused `C030` for
> two cases. `C029` was introduced for the validator-side
> *unknown outputs node reference* error; `C030` now only flags the
> compile-time *Codex backend discouraged* warning. If an older log
> shows `C030` on an `outputs.<unknown>` reference, treat it as the
> modern `C029`.

## Quick Troubleshooting

**"I get C019 (undeclared cycle)"**
Every back-edge (edge that creates a cycle) needs `as loop_name(N)`. Example:
```iter
judge -> agent when not approved as retry(3) with { ... }
```

**"I get C009 (session at convergence)"**
Nodes that receive from multiple branches (via `await:` or fan-out) cannot use `session: inherit` or `fork`. Use `session: fresh` or `session: artifacts_only`.

**"I get C012 (missing fallback)"**
If you have `when approved`, you need either `when not approved` or an unconditional edge from the same source. Conditions must be exhaustive.

**"I get C018 (missing model or backend)"**
For agents and judges, add `model: "..."` or `backend: "..."`, set `ITERION_DEFAULT_SUPERVISOR_MODEL`, or configure detectable backend credentials. For `mode: llm` routers, either set an explicit `model:`/`backend:` or accept the warning and runtime default. For human nodes with `interaction: llm` or `interaction: llm_or_human`, add `model:` or `interaction_model:` and declare an `output:` schema.
