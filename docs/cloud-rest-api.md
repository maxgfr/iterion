# Cloud REST API reference

**Audience.** Anyone calling iterion programmatically — a CI job, an
SDK author, an operator writing curl runbooks. Every endpoint listed
here exists in
[pkg/server/](../pkg/server/); the table is grouped by domain and
machine-grepped from the `register*` functions, not curated by hand.

Authentication. Most routes accept any of:

- **Cookie**: `iterion_auth` (access JWT) + `iterion_refresh` (rotation).
- **Bearer JWT**: `Authorization: Bearer <access-jwt>` issued by login
  / refresh.
- **Bearer PAT**: `Authorization: Bearer iap_…` — long-lived personal
  access token; authenticates **as** the issuing user with that user's
  role + super-admin flag
  ([pkg/server/pat_routes.go:identityFromPAT](../pkg/server/pat_routes.go)).
- **WS query**: `?t=<access-jwt>` for WebSocket clients that can't set
  headers.

Where a route says "team member", "team admin" or "super-admin", the
guard maps to `canViewTeam` / `canManageTeam` / `requireSuperAdmin`.
Webhook delivery URLs (`POST /api/webhooks/<provider>/<id>`) use their
own auth (token bearer or HMAC body signature) and are public to the
JWT layer.

## Non-obvious JSON shapes

### `POST /api/teams/{id}/webhooks` — create response (token-once)

```json
{
  "config": {
    "id": "8e2…",
    "tenant_id": "team_acme",
    "name": "GitLab MR review",
    "provider": "gitlab",
    "sign_mode": "",
    "enabled": true,
    "token_last4": "Vp3a",
    "fingerprint": "sha256:…",
    "bot_ids": ["review-pr"],
    "wildcard_bots": false,
    "project_allowlist": ["acme/*"],
    "event_allowlist": [],
    "rate_limit": { "rate": 1.0, "burst": 10 },
    "monthly_call_limit": 0,
    "launch_vars": {},
    "key_overrides": {},
    "created_by": "user_…",
    "created_at": "2026-06-11T10:11:12Z",
    "updated_at": "2026-06-11T10:11:12Z"
  },
  "token": "iwh_…"
}
```

The `token` field is the **only** way to recover the plaintext. The
same shape comes back from the rotate endpoint.

### Launch-denial envelope

Every gate refusal — REST launch, resume, webhook publication — uses
the same shape ([pkg/server/launch_gate.go](../pkg/server/launch_gate.go)):

```jsonc
{
  "error":    "monthly_run_quota_exceeded",   // stable token
  "detail":   "monthly run quota (1000) exhausted",
  "reset_at": "2026-07-01T00:00:00Z"          // monthly quotas
}
```

Plus the header `Retry-After: <seconds>` on `concurrency_cap_exceeded`
and `launch_rate_limited`. Token list and HTTP semantics in
[quotas-and-limits.md](quotas-and-limits.md).

### `GET /api/teams/{id}/usage` (also `/api/admin/orgs/{id}/usage`)

See [quotas-and-limits.md → Reading usage](quotas-and-limits.md#reading-usage)
for the full `orgUsageView` schema. Same shape on both routes — the
admin endpoint is super-admin only, the team endpoint is any member.

### `POST /api/me/tokens` — create PAT

Request:

```json
{ "name": "github-actions", "team_id": "team_…", "expires_in_days": 90 }
```

Response (plaintext shown once):

```json
{
  "pat":   { "id": "…", "name": "github-actions", "token_last4": "Q9k2", "expires_at": "…", … },
  "token": "iap_…"
}
```

`expires_in_days` is clamped down to `ITERION_PAT_MAX_TTL` when the
platform sets one. `team_id` is optional; without it the PAT inherits
the user's default team and re-checks membership at every use.
