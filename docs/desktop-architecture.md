# Iterion Desktop — Architecture

The desktop build is a thin native shell wrapped around the existing
`pkg/server` HTTP server and embedded SPA. It adds multi-project state,
OS-keychain credentials, signed auto-update, and native UX (menus, window
state, single-instance, dialogs).

## Process model

```
Iterion.app  /  iterion-desktop.exe  /  Iterion.AppImage
└─ cmd/iterion-desktop  (Wails v2 host, build tag `desktop`)
   ├─ Wails Window — webview pinned to AssetServer start URL
   │     wails://wails/  (Mac/Linux)  or  http://wails.localhost/  (Win)
   ├─ Wails AssetServer  (asset_proxy.go)
   │     ├─ /wails/runtime.js, /wails/ipc.js  (Wails-injected, gives
   │     │       the SPA window.go.main.App.* and window.runtime.*)
   │     ├─ /, /assets/*       SPA/static from the GUI binary's embedded
   │     │                     pkg/server.StaticFS
   │     └─ /api/*             reverse-proxy → selected loopback server
   ├─ Selected loopback server (default: per-project headless daemon;
   │  fallback/opt-out: in-process ServerHost via cli.RunStudio)
   │     ├─ /api/*            REST   (proxied via AssetServer)
   │     └─ /api/ws/runs/*    WebSocket runs   (DIRECT — Wails AssetServer
   │                                             returns 501 on WS upgrade)
   ├─ Wails Bindings (Go ↔ JS — reachable because SPA loads on
   │     AssetServer origin where /wails/runtime.js was injected)
   │     ListProjects / SwitchProject / AddProject / RemoveProject
   │     GetSecret… / SetSecret / DeleteSecret
   │     DetectExternalCLIs / IsFirstRunPending / MarkFirstRunDone
   │     CheckForUpdate / DownloadAndApplyUpdate
   │     OpenExternal / RevealInFinder
   │     GetServerURL / GetSessionToken (SPA WS helper; local desktop
   │     returns an empty token and dials ws://127.0.0.1:<port>/api/ws...)
   ├─ Native menus + window state persistence
   └─ Single-instance lock + IPC for "focus existing"
```

## Key decisions

### Why a real `127.0.0.1:<random>` server PLUS Wails AssetServer reverse-proxy

The naive design — load the SPA directly on `http://127.0.0.1:<port>/` —
fails because Wails injects `/wails/runtime.js` and `/wails/ipc.js` ONLY
into HTML responses served by its AssetServer. A page on a different
origin gets no runtime, so `window.go.main.App.*` is `undefined`,
`isDesktop()` returns `false`, and every desktop view silently un-mounts
into "browser mode". (See [ADR-002](adr/002-desktop-assetserver-proxy.md)
for the full investigation that surfaced this in iteration 10.)

The current design solves this by hosting the studio SPA via the Wails
AssetServer's `Handler` (`cmd/iterion-desktop/asset_proxy.go`), so the
WebView's main origin stays on the AssetServer URL for the lifetime of
the app. The handler serves every non-`/api` SPA/static request from the
GUI binary's own `pkg/server.StaticFS` embed; Wails injects the runtime
into the handler's HTML response; bindings remain reachable; and only
`/api/*` HTTP requests are reverse-proxied to the selected loopback
server.

WebSocket upgrades (`/api/ws`, `/api/ws/runs/*`) **cannot** flow through
the AssetServer handler — Wails' AssetServer rejects WS with `501` by
design — so the SPA dials them directly at
`ws://127.0.0.1:<port>/api/ws...`. In current local desktop builds
`GetSessionToken` returns an empty string for SPA compatibility, so the
WS dialer omits any token query parameter. This is the only surface where
the SPA touches the loopback origin directly; normal page/static traffic
is served by the AssetServer handler from the GUI embed, and REST traffic
stays on the AssetServer origin while being proxied to `/api/*`. We keep
a real loopback server (rather than running everything inside the
AssetServer) because:

- `pkg/server` stays 1:1 between CLI (`iterion studio`) and desktop;
- WebSockets keep working without any AssetServer shim;
- the selected server binds to loopback only and runs through the same
  local-editor `DisableAuth=true` path as `iterion studio`, while Origin
  checks still protect browser-initiated writes and WS upgrades.

### Local desktop auth model

By default the desktop host uses per-project headless daemons. On startup
and project switch it finds or launches `iterion-desktop --server-only
--project=<dir>` and points the AssetServer handler's `/api/*` proxy and
direct WS URL at that daemon. Multiple project daemons may coexist; when
the GUI switches projects it attaches to or spawns the new project's
daemon and leaves the previous daemon alive so background runs can
continue.

The in-process `ServerHost` path in `cmd/iterion-desktop/server_host.go`
is now an escape hatch: set `ITERION_DESKTOP_ATTACH_DAEMON=0` (also
`false`, `no`, or `off`) to opt out, or rely on it as the fallback when
daemon attach/spawn fails. That path starts `cli.RunStudio` on
`127.0.0.1` with `Port=-1` and `NoBrowser=true`.

Both the default headless daemon and the in-process fallback use
`cli.RunStudio`, which constructs `pkg/server.Config` with
`DisableAuth=true`. Local desktop mode therefore does not mint a
per-launch session token and does not install cookie/query-token
middleware. The AssetServer handler proxies only `/api/*` HTTP requests to
the loopback server, forces Host to the loopback target, and rewrites
`Origin` to that loopback origin; it does not attach or strip desktop
session cookies. SPA/static requests never reach the loopback server in
current builds; they are served from the GUI embed.

`GetSessionToken` remains exposed on the Wails binding because the SPA's
desktop WS helper calls it together with `GetServerURL`. Today it returns
`""`, and the SPA skips adding a token parameter when the value is empty.
If a future hosted-auth desktop flow wires a real token into this binding,
that token handling should be documented with the auth implementation that
consumes it.

### No tray in v1

System-tray icons require platform-specific code Wails v2 doesn't supply
out-of-the-box. Closing the window leaves the app in the dock/taskbar
(macOS standard) or terminates the process (Win/Linux). Tray is on the v2
backlog.

### Auto-update — Ed25519, not OS code-signing

V1 ships unsigned binaries (Gatekeeper / SmartScreen will warn the first
time). The auto-updater ALWAYS verifies an embedded Ed25519 public key
against signed manifests + artefacts, regardless of OS code-signing. This
is the trust anchor for v1 and remains valid when OS signing is added later.

### Build-tag isolation

The Wails-importing files carry `//go:build desktop`. `go test ./...`
exercises the desktop package's testable subset (config, external_cli,
path_fix non-darwin) without requiring the Wails CLI or its CGO deps.
Producing the real binary uses `wails build -tags desktop` (which also
flips the right CGO/cross flags).

## Backwards compatibility

The `iterion` CLI is unchanged. `iterion studio` still listens on 4891
with the same local `DisableAuth=true` behaviour — the CLI flag flows are untouched. Two binaries
ship from the same module: `iterion` (Cobra CLI) and `iterion-desktop`
(Wails app). Both share `pkg/cli`, `pkg/server`, the SPA, and the run
store on disk.
