// dispatcherPillMeta centralises the copy + colour for the dispatcher
// state pill rendered by DispatcherControlBar. The pill is the
// operator's primary "is the daemon alive?" signal, so every state
// carries a hover explanation — previously `idle` and `unreachable`
// rendered with no title at all.
//
// Extracted as a pure helper (mirroring runStatusMeta.ts) so the
// per-state wording can be unit-tested without mounting the control
// bar.

// DispatcherPillState is the set of states the pill can show. The first
// four mirror dispatcher.ManagerState; "unreachable" is a synthetic UI
// state used when the status endpoint can't be reached at all (the
// `iterion dispatch` process is down or was never started).
